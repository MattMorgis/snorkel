Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a complex, T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by immune cell infiltration and chronic inflammation in the islets of Langerhans. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) resulting from insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. The involvement of inflammatory processes, such as immune cell infiltration, and chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of diabetes is less well understood in T2DM than in T1DM. However, studies conducted in the past decade have shown a strong link between inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. They have also shown that chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of both T1DM and T2DM. Two immunological factors commonly contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes: the activation of inflammasomes and the release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein molecular platforms. DAMPs act as endogenous danger signals. Here, we review current research on the function(s) of inflammasomes and DAMPs and discuss their pathological relevance and therapeutic implications in diabetes. \n \n1 \nIntroduction \n \nNormal glucose homeostasis is achieved through the precise regulation of insulin production and secretion in insulin-producing pancreatic β cells in the islets of Langerhans. Homeostasis also requires an adequate response to insulin in insulin-sensitive tissues, including the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Defects in insulin production and secretion due to β-cell loss and/or diminished responses in insulin-sensitive tissues cause diabetes mellitus (  ADA, 2014  ). Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which glucose metabolism is dysregulated. Patients with diabetes exhibit hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) and deranged metabolism. Subsequent complications include damage, dysfunction, and failure of many organs, including the eyes, kidneys, heart, and blood vessels (  ADA, 2014  ). There are many types of diabetes, including genetic defects in β cell and insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes, other genetic syndromes sometimes associated with diabetes, and gestational diabetes mellitus. The two principal types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM, respectively) (  ADA, 2014  ). \n \nT1DM, previously referred to as “insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus” or “juvenile diabetes,” is a complex, T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by immune cell infiltration and chronic inflammation in the islets of Langerhans. T1DM is caused by the specific, cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of β cells, which leads to absolute insulin deficiency (  Daneman, 2006  ). The development of T1DM is under the control of multiple genetic factors. It is also associated with the impaired elimination of apoptotic β-cell remnants and environmental factors such as infectious agents, toxins, and foods that alter regulatory functions in the innate and adaptive immune systems (  Daneman, 2006  ). Activation of the adaptive immune system in response to genetic and environmental interactions is relatively common in the pathogenesis of T1DM (  Daneman, 2006; Zóka et al., 2013  ). However, recent studies have provided evidence that the innate immune system also participates in the pathogenesis of T1DM. Indeed, a number of studies over the past decade have indicated that activation of the innate immune system by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) plays an essential role in T1DM onset. PRRs include membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) (reviewed in Grishman et al., 2012  ). These receptors recognize specific pathogens or microbial-derived products called pathogen- or microbial-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs). They also recognize endogenous danger signals from damaged cells, referred to as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) ( Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). The binding of PAMPs, MAMPs, or DAMPs to PRRs induces an inflammatory response within the islets that promotes the production of various multifunctional inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β). IL-1β, encoded by IL-1B and secreted by macrophages, recruits inflammatory cells to the islets, leading to direct cytotoxic responses to β cells (  Donath et al., 2003; Mathis et al., 2001  ). Thus, T1DM is considered an inflammatory disease of islets. In genetically predisposed individuals, environmental factors trigger the destruction of β cells by initiating a cell-mediated immune response. The response involves islet-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (  Donath et al., 2003; Mathis et al., 2001  ). PAMPs and DAMPs contribute to the destruction of β cells by inducing a mixture of β-cell necrosis and apoptosis (  Zóka et al., 2013  ). \n \nT2DM is the most prevalent type of diabetes. It is one of the most important chronic diseases because of its prevalence worldwide and its potential long-term consequences, which include macrovascular complications (such as atherosclerosis and amputation) and microvascular complications (such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) (  Donath and Shoelson, 2011  ). T2DM is a chronic autoinflammatory disease in which a combination of insulin resistance (impairment of insulin action) in peripheral tissues and β-cell failure (decreased β-cell mass and an inadequate insulin secretory response) results in hyperglycemia ( Donath and Shoelson, 2011  ). Insulin resistance leads to increased metabolic demand for insulin in peripheral tissues; this precedes the development of hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency resulting from β-cell dysfunction ( Kasuga, 2006  ). Insulin resistance is typically present for a long period before the development of overt T2DM because β cells respond to the increased metabolic demand for insulin by increasing insulin secretion. This hypersecretion of insulin involves an expansion of β-cell mass and enhancement of the insulin secretory function. T2DM develops when β cells are unable to meet the metabolic demand because of a deterioration in β cell function, which is associated with inadequate expansion of β-cell mass or failure of the existing β-cell mass to respond to glucose. Indeed, studies in both rodent and human islets have shown that T2D entails loss of β-cell mass via increased apoptosis rather than decreased β-cell proliferation (  Montane et al., 2014  ). Several mechanisms cause insulin resistance and β-cell failure in T2DM. These include glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, endocannabinoids (ECs), and amyloid deposition in the pancreas (reviewed in  Donath and Shoelson, 2011  ). In addition, increasing evidence indicates that these mechanisms contribute to inflammatory processes involving immune cell infiltration, cytokine production, apoptosis, amyloid deposition, and eventual fibrosis, as well as chronic low-grade systemic inflammation ( Donath et al., 2003; Donath and Shoelson, 2011; Grant and Dixit, 2013; Masters et al., 2010  ). Inflammation leads to elevated levels of circulating proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins (ILs), and adipokines. It is directly linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and the initiation and progression of T2DM ( Spranger et al., 2003  ). The processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines during T2DM are regulated by inflammasomes, particularly the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Inflammasomes sense DAMPs (  Schroder et al., 2010  ), which include various endogenous metabolic byproducts, such as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), and cause sterile inflammation ( Chen and Nuñez, 2010  ). As a sensor of metabolic danger, the NLRP3 inflammasome controls insulin resistance and β-cell failure in T2DM (  Mandrup-Poulsen et al., 2010; Stienstra et al., 2010, 2011; Vandanmagsar et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010; [6]  ). \n \nDiabetes treatment aims at improving glycemic control, which in turn diminishes the risk of associated complications. Current treatment typically begins with lifestyle modifications, with the subsequent addition of antidiabetic agents such as insulin, biguanides metformin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, incretin analogues, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors ( Bailey, 2005; Dardano et al., 2014; Donath, 2014; Kim and Egan, 2008  ). These medications decrease glucose levels by improving β-cell function and mass, improving insulin sensitivity, or providing exogenous insulin. Although treatments can delay the onset of diabetes, glycemia in diabetic patients is poorly controlled because current medications address the symptoms of diabetes but not the underlying pathophysiology. Furthermore, most antidiabetic agents are associated with undesirable side effects. These include weight gain and hypoglycemia for sulphonylureas or insulin; gastrointestinal symptoms for biguanides; and weight gain, peripheral edema, and bone fractures for thiazolidinediones (  Dardano et al., 2014  ). Therefore, new treatments for diabetes should aim to correct glycemia with minimal side effects while preventing disease progression by targeting the underlying causes. \n \nIn this review, we focus on the roles of inflammasomes and DAMPs and their pathological relevance to the development of diabetes. We also discuss current therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diabetes. \n \n2 \nPRRs and inflammasomes in diabetes \n \nInflammation is a complex biological response to pathogen-induced tissue injury and danger signals. Its goal is to protect living tissues and initiate healing by eliminating injurious agents and damaged tissue components. The inflammatory response is mediated by immune system activation, which leads to the recruitment of inflammatory components to the injury site, particularly, innate immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. PRRs on the surface of these cells recognize PAMPs and DAMPs. The subsequent activation of the cells leads to the eradication of harmful pathogens and danger signals. In addition, the processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines lead to the activation and recruitment of adaptive immune cells ( Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). In the absence of infection, the same innate inflammatory responses can also be activated in response to tissue injury due to trauma, ischemia-reperfusion injury, chemically induced injury, or cellular and metabolic dysfunction. This response is commonly referred to as sterile inflammation ( Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Rock et al., 2010  ). Similar to infection-induced inflammation, sterile inflammation is crucial for the neutralization and sequestration of injurious agents, the removal of damaged cells, and tissue and wound repair. It is mediated by innate immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Rock et al., 2010  ). In response to tissue damage, these cells are recruited to the injury site, where they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including TNF and interleukin-1 (IL-1). However, a continuous inflammatory response to persistent infection or prolonged exposure to an offending agent can cause chronic inflammation, resulting in elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and ultimately causing chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Donath, 2014; Donath and Shoelson, 2011; Lukens et al., 2012; Rock et al., 2010  ). \n \n2.1 \nPRRs \n \nGermline-encoded PRRs are host receptors that trigger the innate immune response to infectious pathogens and coordinate the inflammatory response in order to eliminate pathogens (  Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). PRRs are considered the initial sensors of infection. The molecules sense conserved structural moieties (PAMPs) found in infectious pathogens. PRRs are also involved in the activation of sterile inflammation by DAMPs, which are released from host cells following tissue injury or cell death. Thus, there are similarities between the pathogen-induced and sterile stimulus-induced inflammatory responses (  Schaefer, 2014; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). Five classes of PRRs have been described: (1) TLRs, found on the cellular plasma membrane or associated with endosomal and endoplasmic reticulum membranes; (2) NLRs, intracellular receptors in the cytosol; (3) retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), intracellular receptors involved in antiviral responses; (4) C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), transmembrane receptors that bind to carbohydrates in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner; and (5) absence in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors, pyrin and HIN domain-containing receptors that recognize intracellular microbial double-stranded DNA (  Schaefer, 2014  ). These PRRs are typically expressed in macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and various non-professional immune cells (  Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). The intracellular signaling cascades triggered by these PRRs, such as the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and type I interferon pathways, induce gene transcription, resulting in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are important in inflammatory responses ( Schaefer, 2014; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). \n \nIn addition to PRRs, several DAMP-specific receptors that are not typically considered PRRs recognize DAMPs, including receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGEs), the best-studied DAMP-specific receptor ( Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Schaefer, 2014  ). Although RAGE was initially identified as a receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) (  Schmidt et al., 1992  ), it has since been shown to act as a receptor for a number of DAMPs, including high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) (  Hori et al., 1995  ), S100 proteins (  Hofmann et al., 1999  ), and β-amyloid (  Yan et al., 1996  ). Ligand-RAGE interactions activate several inflammatory signaling pathways, including the NF-κB, MAPK, and phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathways, thereby inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF (  Hofmann et al., 1999; Xie et al., 2013  ). RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and it is present on many cell types, including immune cells, neurons, and cardiomyocytes ( Xie et al., 2013  ). Its expression is abnormally regulated in diabetes (  Xie et al., 2013  ). Moreover, several studies have suggested that RAGE plays multiple roles not only in diabetes-related complications, but also in the pathogenesis of T1DM and T2DM. The roles of RAGE and its ligands in diabetes are discussed below in more detail. \n \n2.2 \nInflammasomes \n \nIL-1β is mainly produced by macrophages during disease or as inactive pro-IL-1β following injury. It is a prominent proinflammatory mediator that plays a central role in sterile inflammation (  Dinarello, 2011  ). By signaling through the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-1β recruits neutrophils and monocytes (  Wang et al., 1995  ) and triggers the production of additional proinflammatory mediators (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010  ). Inactive pro-IL-1β must be cleaved into a biologically active form; this process is mediated by caspase-1, which also cleaves IL-18 into its active form. Under inflammatory stress, the activity of caspase-1 is dependent on its recruitment to multiprotein procaspase-1 activation complexes known as inflammasomes (  Schroder and Tschopp, 2010  ). IL-1β levels in blood and islets are elevated in T1DM and T2DM (  Schroder et al., 2010  ). Elevation of IL-1β contributes to the progression of inflammation and the induction of insulin resistance by inhibiting insulin signaling in insulin target tissues. It also mediates the cytotoxic effects of chronic exposure to high glucose in β cells by inducing Fas death receptor-dependent apoptosis, leading to β-cell loss and failure (  Maedler et al. 2002  ). The process is mediated by a number of inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Pharmacological blockade by IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) (  Maedler et al., 2002; Sauter et al., 2008  ) or genetic deficiency of IL-1β (  Maedler et al., 2006  ) improves glucose tolerance and β-cell function and prevents the cytotoxic effects of high glucose in β cells. Macrophages are the primary source of IL-1β. However, when chronically exposed to elevated glucose, β cells also produce and secrete IL-1β, at a level sufficient to exert an autocrine effect on β-cell survival and function (  Maedler et al., 2002, 2006; Sauter et al., 2008; [3]  ). The inflammasome plays a critical role in IL-1β production. \n \nThe inflammasome is a large, multimeric, danger-sensing platform composed of cytosolic PRR, pro-caspase-1, and – depending on the PRR – an adaptor molecule. It assembles in response to whole pathogens or a number of structurally diverse PAMPs, DAMPs, and environmental irritants. By promoting the autocatalytic activation of caspase-1, the inflammasome triggers the maturation of inactive pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to engage innate immune defenses (  Schroder and Tschopp, 2010  ). Several inflammasomes have been identified to date (reviewed in Schroder and Tschopp, 2010  ). Two inflammasomes, NLRP3 and AIM2, have been characterized as sensors of sterile injury and disease. NLRP3, the best characterized inflammasome, can recognize a wide range of structurally diverse DAMPs (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010  ). Upon exposure to host-derived DAMPs associated with diverse types of sterile injury, NLRP3 oligomerizes with adaptor molecules (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain [ASC] and pro-caspase-1) to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. Assembly of these components leads to the autocatalytic cleavage and activation of pro-caspase-1, which directly mediates the proteolytic maturation and release of active IL-1β, leading to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis \nStudies of mouse models with targeted deletion of genes related to the NLRP3 inflammasome have provided strong evidence that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in the development of insulin resistance ( Stienstra et al., 2010, 2011; Vandanmagsar et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010; [5]  ). Deficiency of NLRP3 or associated genes such as Asc / Pycard and caspase-1 ( Casp1 −/− ) results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity after high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, likely due to enhanced insulin signaling. Inflammation in insulin target tissues such as the liver, muscle, and adipose tissues also decreases. The findings link the NLRP3 inflammasome to chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. However, deletion of Casp-1 in either of two T1DM models (spontaneous T-cell-mediated diabetes in NOD/Lt or toxin-mediated destruction of NOD β-cells) did not affect the rate or total incidence of diabetes or the sensitivity to streptozotocin, despite the reduction in IL-1β and IL-18 levels (  Schott et al., 2004  ). These results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome is not required for the development of T1DM. \n \nAmong NLRs, the NLRP3 inflammasome is unique in its ability to recognize DAMPs. Several recent studies have provided strong evidence that its activation in response to DAMPs plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetes by controlling the processing and secretion of IL-1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (  Wen et al., 2012  ). Indeed, multiple endogenous diabetes-related DAMPs that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome have been identified, including glucose; islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP; also known as amylin); palmitate; ceramide; RAGE ligands such as AGE, HMGB1, and S100 proteins; and ECs ( Table 1 ). Chronic hyperglycemia, a danger signal in T2DM, leads to the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent production and release of IL-1β by β cells, which in turn promotes β-cell dysfunction and Fas-triggered β-cell death by activating the transcription factor NF-κB ( Maedler et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2010  ). Other studies have suggested that IAPP, a hormone secreted with insulin, is deposited in the islet interstitium, leading to the formation of an amyloid structure that promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β cleavage (  Masters et al., 2010  ). These aggregates cause β-cell dysfunction and loss in the islets of T2DM patients and in islets transplanted into T1DM patients, suggesting that IAPP is an important DAMP in diabetes (  Westermark et al., 2011  ). Long-chain saturated fatty acids (FFAs) such as palmitate and ceramide, but not unsaturated oleate, are also considered danger signals in diabetes. They lead to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 (  Vandanmagsar et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2011  ). This in turn causes impaired insulin signaling and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. These molecules and other endogenous diabetes-related DAMPs that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome are discussed below in more detail ( Fig. 2 ).  \n \n3 \nDAMPs and diabetes \n \n3.1 \nDAMPs \n \nDAMPs are endogenous proinflammatory mediators that convey a danger signal to the immune system ( Matzinger, 1994  ). Under normal conditions in healthy living cells, these endogenous molecules are sequestered from the immune system to prevent pathological inflammation and autoimmunity (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Kono and Rock, 2008; Seong and Matzinger, 2004  ). DAMPs play an important role in normal cell homeostasis ( Huang et al., 2014; Kono and Rock, 2008; Rosin and Okusa, 2011  ). For example, HMGB1, an abundant DNA-binding protein in all mammalian nuclei, facilitates the assembly of recombination and transcriptional complexes at the minor groove of DNA, thereby contributing to recombination and transcriptional activation ( Thomas and Travers, 2001  ). This function is essential for normal cellular homeostasis: HMGB1 deficiency leads to impairment of gene expression, and Hmgb1 -null mice die within 24 h of birth as a result of hypoglycemia ( Calogero et al., 1999  ). However, when DAMPs are released into the extracellular environment from damaged or dying cells following cellular stress or injury, they are recognized as danger signals, and they ultimately lead to the development of sterile inflammation. DAMP release is usually induced by necrotic cell death (necrosis) or unprogrammed cell death, rather than by apoptosis (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Kono and Rock, 2008  ). Apoptosis, which is mediated by an orchestrated caspase signaling cascade, ultimately leads to the formation of apoptotic bodies, which can effectively be cleared by phagocytes to prevent the release of endogenous immunogenic molecules into the extracellular space. In contrast, necrosis leads to the rupture of the plasma membrane, which can result in the release of DAMPs and the development of sterile inflammation (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Kono and Rock, 2008  ). \n \nAlthough DAMPs are structurally heterogeneous, they generally induce uniform inflammatory responses, including the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the induction of T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses (  Mbitikon-Kobo et al., 2009  ). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the induction of sterile inflammation by endogenous DAMPs: (1) recognition and activation of DAMPs by PRRs, (2) secretion of intracellular cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1α and IL-33, and (3) direct activation through DAMP receptors that are not typically considered PRRs ( Chen and Nuñez, 2010  ). Through these mechanisms, DAMPs upregulate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1β, which recruit and activate additional inflammatory cells. \n \nThe growing list of DAMPs includes host-derived molecules from intracellular and extracellular sources. Their effects on the development of sterile inflammation have been described. Moreover, as mentioned above, there is strong evidence that DAMPs play a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetes by controlling the processing and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Multiple diabetes-related endogenous DAMPs have been identified, including glucose, IAPP, palmitate, ceramide, ECs, and RAGE ligands such as AGE, HMGB1, and S100 proteins ( Table 1 ). \n \n3.2 \nGlucose \n \nA high glucose level is a strong danger signal in diabetes. Chronic physiological increase in circulating glucose leads to progressive impairment of insulin secretion and β-cell death in an autocrine manner and contributes to insulin resistance (  Maedler et al., 2002; Tack et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2010  ). Glucose induces IL-1β secretion from several cell types, including endothelial cells, monocytes, β cells, and other islet cells. In turn, IL-1β mediates the deleterious effects of high glucose by inducing Fas-triggered apoptosis through NF-κB and JNK and/or by inhibiting insulin signaling in both T1DM and T2DM (  Maedler et al., 2002; Mandrup-Poulsen, 1996; Tack et al., 2012  ). Activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an NLRP3-activating cofactor linked to diabetes and insulin resistance, is involved in glucose-induced IL-1β production (  Zhou et al., 2010  ). TXNIP expression is stimulated by glucose and upregulated in several tissues in diabetic patients and diabetic mice (  Minn et al., 2005  ). TXNIP binds and activates NLRP3 in a ROS-dependent manner. In response to a high glucose level, TXNIP dissociates from thioredoxin and binds the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the subsequent production of IL-1β (  Koenen et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010  ). Consistently, TXNIP-deficient mice show not only impaired activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome but improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (  Zhou et al., 2010  ). In animal models of T1DM, deficiency of TXNIP results in higher circulating and intra-islet insulin levels, higher β-cell mass, and greater resistance to the development of streptozotocin-induced diabetes than that in control mice (  Masson et al., 2009  ). A recent study has also shown that a high level of glucose likely enhances IL-1β expression at the transcriptional level by regulating the TXNIP-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in human adipose tissue ( Koenen et al., 2011  ). Additionally , IL-1β expression is elevated in the β cells of patients with T2DM; glucose promotes the increase in expression (  Böni-Schnetzler et al., 2008  ). Collectively , these data suggest that chronic hyperglycemia is a key inducer of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production and is an important danger signal in the pathogenesis of diabetes. \n \n3.3 \nIAPP \n \nAnother major danger signal in diabetes is IAPP, also known as amylin. IAPP, along with insulin, is one of the major peptides secreted by β cells. It aggregates into insoluble islet amyloid deposits. Aggregated IAPP has cytotoxic effects and causes β-cell dysfunction and loss in the islets of T2DM patients and in islets transplanted into T1DM patients (  Westermark et al., 2011; Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). IAPP promotes the generation of mature IL-1β by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and DCs, but not in β cells (  Masters et al., 2010; Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). Indeed, oligomers of amyloidogenic human IAPP (hIAPP), but not nonamyloidogenic rat IAPP, activate caspase-1 and the NLRP3 inflammasome to produce mature IL-1β. The hIAPP-mediated activation of IL-1β depends on a priming process that requires glucose metabolism, but not on ROS-sensitive TXNIP. Furthermore, in mice transgenic for hIAPP expression, higher levels of IL-1β co-localize with amyloid and macrophages, but not with insulin. In addition, hIAPP also increases Il1b mRNA levels in macrophages and contributes to islet inflammation by recruiting and activating macrophages ( Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). Moreover, IL-1Ra reduces hIAPP-induced proinflammatory cytokine release and improves glucose tolerance in diabetic NOD/SCID mice transplanted with islets from hIAPP-expressing transgenic mice. A recent study has also identified CD36, a cell surface PRR, as a pivotal regulator of the lysosome-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. CD36 facilitates the intracellular conversion of soluble IAPP into its amyloid form (  Sheedy et al., 2013  ), leading to IL-1β secretion. The findings suggest that CD36 links the recognition of IAPP with the priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in diabetes. \n \n3.4 \nPalmitate \n \nAcute elevation and chronic elevation of circulating FFAs and their metabolites are key risk factors for insulin resistance and T2DM (  Boden, 2002  ). Many lines of evidence indicate that palmitate, one of the most abundant FFAs, induces inflammatory responses by directly engaging several PRRs, including TLRs and NLRP3, and by inducing the NF-κB-mediated production of inflammatory cytokines (  Shi et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2011  ). Palmitate activates intracellular inflammatory signaling to induce proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages, adipocytes, and liver tissue via TLR4 signaling (  Shi et al., 2006  ). TLR4 acts as a “sensor” for palmitate and contributes to palmitate-induced insulin resistance by suppressing insulin signaling. Elevated levels of palmitate, but not unsaturated oleate, also induce NLRP3–ASC inflammasome activation in bone marrow-derived macrophages via an AMPK-autophagy-ROS signaling pathway. Activation promotes caspase-1 and IL-1β production, resulting in impaired insulin signaling in vitro and insulin resistance in vivo in mice fed a HFD ( Wen et al., 2011  ). Additionally, it has been reported that palmitate can induce IL-1β secretion in cultured islets ( Böni-Schnetzler et al., 2009; Ehses et al., 2010  ), implying that palmitate regulates β-cell function by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. \n \n3.5 \nCeramide \n \nCeramide, a lipid metabolite consisting of variable-length fatty acids linked to sphingosine, is clearly associated with inflammatory cytokine production and the development of insulin resistance (  Samuel and Shulman, 2012  ). Plasma ceramide levels are elevated in obese and diabetic subjects and are correlated with insulin sensitivity. Saturated FFAs such as palmitate can induce the intracellular accumulation of ceramide, and ceramide is required for palmitate-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling (  Chavez et al., 2003  ). As a bioactive lipid intermediate, ceramide is considered another danger signal. It induces an inflammatory response mediated by tissue-resident immune cells, such as macrophages or DCs, to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in obese subjects with T2DM (  Vandanmagsar et al., 2011  ). Elevated levels of ceramide are recognized by the NLRP3 inflammasome, the activation of which leads to caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1β secretion in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages. Consistently, deficiency of NLRP3 in obese mice prevents ceramide-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion and enhances insulin signaling. These findings suggest that, in addition to acting directly as a danger signal, palmitate can induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation by providing a continuous supply of another danger signal, ceramide. However, neither palmitate nor ceramide leads to NLRP3 inflammasome activation or the subsequent secretion of IL-1β without the priming signal, LPS. \n \n3.6 \nRAGE ligands (HMGB1, S100 protein, and AGE) \n \nRAGE and its ligands play direct roles in diabetes development and complications. RAGE and its ligand, S100 protein, are present in the islets of diabetic NOD/SCID mice transplanted with diabetogenic spleen cells from NOD mice. Furthermore, soluble RAGE, a scavenger of RAGE ligands, delays the transfer of diabetes and reduces the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α (  Chen et al., 2004  ). Although soluble RAGE has no effect on glucose or lipid levels in diabetic animal models, it represses the increased vascular inflammation associated with diabetes ( Wendt et al., 2006  ). Recent studies have suggested that RAGE and its ligand play direct roles in β-cell survival and function, in addition to causing diabetic complications (  Lee et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2011  ). RAGE is present on rodent and human β cells, and its ligands (HMGB1 and S100 protein) induce β-cell death mediated by NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation (  Lee et al., 2010  ). Another RAGE ligand, AGE, also induces β-cell death by decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and increasing cytochrome c release in a RAGE-dependent manner ( Zhu et al., 2011  ). Furthermore, the AGE-RAGE interaction not only decreases insulin mRNA levels but also promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via the FoxO1-mediated repression of Pdx-1 expression ( Shu et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011  ). Pdx-1 is a transcription factor essential for pancreatic β-cell maturation ( Ahlgren et al., 1998  ) and insulin biosynthesis (  Ohlsson et al., 1993  ). FoxO1 acts as a transcriptional repressor of Pdx-1 expression (  Kitamura et al., 2002  ). These data suggest that RAGE ligands are important danger signals in diabetes development and complications. \n \n3.7 \nEndocannabinoids \n \nEndocannabinoids (ECs) such as anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are lipid ligands of the G protein-coupled receptor CB1R. They are only synthesized on demand in response to membrane depolarization, primarily in the brain but also in peripheral tissues. CB1R activation by ECs induces obesity-related inflammatory changes and insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, and β-cell loss and dysfunction. Conversely, pharmacological and genetic blockade of CB1Rs improves these adverse effects, suggesting that increased EC tone (due to increased EC synthesis, receptor expression, or activity) contributes to the development of obesity and diabetes and their complications (  Pacher and Kunos, 2013  ). Indeed, elevated EC levels in the blood and in the pancreas are observed in diabetes and obesity. Insulin target tissues produce and secrete ECs in an intracellular Ca 2+ -dependent manner. In response to glucose, ECs are also produced and secreted from pancreatic β cells, in which CB1R activation contributes to β-cell death by inhibiting insulin signaling in animal models of T1DM and T2DM (  Kim et al. 2011  ). \n \nPrevious studies have shown that macrophages express CB1R (  Han et al., 2009  ) and produce ECs ( Di Marzo et al., 1996  ). CB1R and EC levels are elevated under pro-inflammatory conditions. Agonist-stimulated CB1R activation of macrophages also induces pro-inflammatory signaling (  Han et al., 2009; Varga et al., 1998  ), leading to the transmigration of macrophages into islets. Via the CB1R-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in infiltrating macrophages, ECs induce the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, resulting in β-cell loss in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (  Jourdan et al., 2013  ). Peripheral CB1R blockade, in vivo depletion of macrophages, or selective knockdown of macrophage CB1R reverses or prevents these changes and restores normoglycemia by protecting β-cell functions. These findings implicate ECs and inflammasome activation in β-cell failure in T2DM. Although ECs have not been conventionally considered DAMPs, these findings suggest that they are an important danger signal recognized by PRRs. \n \n4 \nTherapeutic implications and human studies \n \nDespite accumulating evidence linking DAMPs to diabetes pathogenesis and complications, only a few therapeutic strategies that directly target DAMPs have been developed for the treatment of diabetes. As one example, in a rodent model of T1DM, downregulation of HMGB1 expression by lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA or inhibition of its activity by neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibody alleviates myocardial fibrosis and dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy (  Wang et al., 2014  ). Although their effects on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation in diabetic patients are unclear, DAMPs might have potential therapeutic applications in diabetes if diabetes-related endogenous DAMPs can be selectively eliminated or inactivated using small molecules, antibodies, specific enzymes, or RNA interference with siRNAs or microRNAs. However, current therapeutic approaches mainly focus on inhibiting or neutralizing the major downstream molecules in the DAMP-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway, such as the inflammasome and IL-1β. In this context, anakinra (Kineret; Amgen/Biovitrum), humanized monoclonal antibodies against IL-1β (gevokizumab, canakinumab, and LY2189102), glyburide (glibenclamide; Roche/Sanofi-Aventis), metformin, and peripheral CB1R inverse agonists are good examples. \n \nAnakinra, a recombinant human IL-1Ra normally used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibits IL-1 receptor signaling by acting as an IL-1 receptor antagonist (  Larsen et al., 2007  ). Although the sample size used in the clinical study was small, T2DM patients treated with anakinra for 13 weeks showed decreased glucose levels, improved β-cell function, and reduced systemic inflammation with no significant effects on insulin sensitivity ( Larsen et al., 2007  ). A follow-up study showed that improved β-cell function and reduced inflammation persisted for 39 weeks following the withdrawal of anakinra treatment (  Larsen et al., 2009  ), indicating that IL-1 antagonism has long-lasting effects. Even in prediabetic individuals, treatment with anakinra improves β-cell function, implying that it might prevent or delay the onset of T2DM (  Donath, 2014; van Asseldonk et al., 2011  ). Consistently, anakinra improves glucose tolerance and β-cell function and survival by preventing the actions of glucose in human islets (  Maedler et al., 2002  ). In rodent models of T2DM, IL-1 antagonism with anakinra reduces inflammation in insulin target tissues and islets, decreases hyperglycemia, and improves β-cell function and survival (  Ehses et al., 2009; Sauter et al., 2008; Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). The anakinra-mediated decrease in inflammation improves IAPP-induced β-cell dysfunction and impairment in glucose tolerance ( Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). In addition, it improves insulin sensitivity, likely by reducing inflammation in insulin target tissues (  Ehses et al., 2009  ). In contrast, despite a significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels, anakinra had no significant effects on insulin sensitivity in human subjects with T2DM (  Larsen et al., 2007  ). Consistently, insulin-regulated gene expression in skeletal muscle, serum adipokine levels, and the body-mass index did not differ significantly after anakinra treatment and placebo treatment (  Larsen et al., 2007  ). Similar results were obtained in a study of prediabetic individuals, in which an increase in insulin sensitivity after anakinra treatment was not observed (  van Asseldonk et al., 2011  ). \n \nAlthough anakinra has long-lasting effects after treatment withdrawal (  Larsen et al., 2009  ), it must be injected daily because of its short half-life. Moreover, it often causes side effects, such as injection site reactions ( Donath, 2014; Larsen et al., 2007; Nuki et al., 2002  ). Given that antibodies allow for monthly or less frequent dosing and have high specificity to IL-1β, many groups have developed humanized monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1β and tested them in T2DM. A single dose of gevokizumab had beneficial effects on glycemic control and β-cell function, possibly by enhancing insulin secretion and sensitivity, and it reduced hemoglobin A1c levels and inflammation in patients with T2DM (  Cavelti-Weder et al., 2012  ). Canakinumab, another human monoclonal antibody against IL-1β, induced modest improvements in insulin secretion and glycemic control and reduced hemoglobin A1c levels in patients with T2DM (  Hensen et al., 2013; Rissanen et al., 2012  ). Finally, weekly subcutaneous administrations of LY2189102 for 12 weeks reduced blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, as well as inflammatory biomarkers (  Sloan-Lancaster et al., 2013  ). \n \nRecent studies have demonstrated that the currently used antidiabetic drugs have effects on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β production beyond their well-defined metabolic effects (  Donath, 2014; Grant and Dixit, 2013  ). For example, glyburide is a widely used second-generation sulfonylurea antidiabetic drug that inhibits ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP ) in pancreatic β cells (  Ashcroft, 2005  ). Glyburide reduces DAMP-induced IL-1β production by preventing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, but its interaction with K ATP channels is dispensable for inflammasome inhibition because other sulfonylurea drugs have no effect on inflammasome activation (  Lamkanfi et al., 2009  ). Moreover, recent studies have also shown that glyburide prevents IAPP- and glucose-mediated activation of the inflammasome and IL-1β production in rodent macrophages (  Masters et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010  ). However, as discussed by the authors, it is unclear if the dose (5 μg/ml) of glyburide used in the study would have significant effects on inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in patients with T2DM (  Masters et al., 2010  ). The question might warrant a more thorough clinical study because this dose is higher than the dose now used clinically for the treatment of T2DM. In addition, through AMP-activated protein kinase activation, 2 months of therapy with metformin significantly reduced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the maturation of IL-1β in macrophages from drug-naïve patients with newly diagnosed T2DM (  Lee et al., 2013  ). In agreement with previous data from rodents, the maturation of IL-1β and the cleavage of caspase-1 were significantly elevated in macrophages from T2DM patients treated with diabetes-related endogenous DAMPs, including IAPP and HMGB1 (  Lee et al., 2013  ). \n \nEC levels are elevated in insulin target tissues and blood from patients with T2DM (  Matias et al., 2006  ). Thus, overactive CB1Rs in insulin target tissues likely contribute to the development of insulin resistance and β-cell failure in T2DM. Indeed, pharmacological blockade of CB1R by its antagonists and inverse agonists contributes to reduced body weight, improves glycemic control and insulin resistance, and enhances β-cell function and survival in rodents and in humans (  Addy et al., 2008; Després et al., 2005; Jourdan et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011, 2012; Ravinet Trillou et al., 2003; [6]  ). Rimonabant monotherapy also improves glycemic control, body weight, and lipid profiles in drug-naïve patients with T2DM (  Rosenstock et al., 2008  ). Unfortunately, this class of drug has been withdrawn from the market and clinical trials because of potentially life-threatening psychiatric side effects such as anxiety, depression, and suicidality (  Le Foll et al., 2009  ). Consequently, several groups have developed peripherally acting CB1R antagonists with poor brain penetrance to lessen the psychiatric side effects ( LoVerme et al., 2009; Son et al., 2010; Tam et al., 2010, 2012; [4]  ). Selective targeting of peripheral CB1Rs by peripherally acting compounds has beneficial effects on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and fatty liver ( Tam et al. 2010  ). A recent study has shown that the peripherally acting CB1R inverse agonist JD5037 delays the progression of T2DM by preventing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pro-inflammatory responses in pancreatic β cells (  Jourdan et al., 2013  ). This suggests that CB1R antagonists or inverse agonists with poor brain penetrance might be useful therapies in T2DM. They would be expected to lessen insulin resistance in insulin target tissues and improve β-cell function and survival by preventing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β production. \n \n5 \nDAMP-mediated diabetes and ageing \n \nAgeing is associated with the accumulation of damage at the cellular and tissue levels, followed by low-grade chronic inflammation (sterile inflammation) in multiple organs that leads to functional decline with advancing age (  Huang et al., 2014  ). Therefore, ageing is a significant risk factor for multiple chronic inflammation-associated diseases, especially diabetes (  Huang et al., 2014  ). Accumulating evidence indicates that DAMPs and their receptors provide a molecular link between diabetes and ageing by mediating sterile inflammation. As in diabetes, aberrant expression and release of DAMPs have been reported in ageing (  Huang et al., 2014  ). In the healthy condition, DAMPs usually play an important role in sustaining normal cellular homeostasis ( Huang et al., 2014; Kono and Rock, 2008; Rosin and Okusa, 2011  ). However, the release of DAMPs into the extracellular environment from damaged or dying cells after cellular stress or injury ultimately induces excessive sterile inflammation, likely leading to a functional decline in multiple organs and in turn promoting the ageing process. A recent study suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a major sensor of the age-related accumulation of DAMPs; as an interaction platform, it mediates crosstalk between diabetes and ageing at the molecular level (  Youm et al., 2013  ). The accumulation of various DAMPs induces the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to low-grade chronic inflammation in ageing. Genetic blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome improves multiple age-related degenerative changes in the periphery and in the brain, including glycemic control, bone loss, thymic demise, and decreased cognitive function and motor performance ( Youm et al., 2013  ). These responses are consistent with the hypothesis that low-grade chronic inflammation promotes age-related degenerative changes. Taken together, studies of DAMPs and their receptors, especially the NLRP3 inflammasome, provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism linking diabetes and ageing. Thus, approaches to detect and dampen DAMPs and NLRP3 inflammasome activation might provide a new opportunity for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in diabetes and ageing. \n \n6 \nConclusion \n \nIn recent decades, the worldwide incidence of diabetes has increased dramatically. The disease is now one of the most serious global threats to public health. As described here, accumulating data suggest a potential role for DAMPs in the development and complications of both T1DM and T2DM. Progress has been made in identifying DAMPs that act as endogenous danger signals of sterile inflammation and diabetes. Characterization of their receptors, the molecular mechanisms underlying their recognition, and their downstream signaling pathways has also begun. Thus, targeting DAMPs, their receptors, or downstream molecules might be a promising approach for treating inflammatory conditions and diabetes. However, many questions and challenges remain. These challenges include identifying additional endogenous DAMPs involved in diabetes, determining of their physiological significance, developing strategies for DAMP modulation as effective therapies, and understanding how to selectively target DAMPs without hindering their actions under normal physiological conditions. \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning ( NRF-2012R1A1A1041352 ) and funded by the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea ( NRF-2009-0093826 ). \n \n
