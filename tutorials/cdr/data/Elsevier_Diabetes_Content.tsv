Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a complex, T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by immune cell infiltration and chronic inflammation in the islets of Langerhans. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a complex metabolic disease characterized by hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) resulting from insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction. The involvement of inflammatory processes, such as immune cell infiltration, and chronic inflammation in the pathogenesis of diabetes is less well understood in T2DM than in T1DM. However, studies conducted in the past decade have shown a strong link between inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. They have also shown that chronic inflammation plays a key role in the pathogenesis of both T1DM and T2DM. Two immunological factors commonly contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes: the activation of inflammasomes and the release of proinflammatory cytokines in response to damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein molecular platforms. DAMPs act as endogenous danger signals. Here, we review current research on the function(s) of inflammasomes and DAMPs and discuss their pathological relevance and therapeutic implications in diabetes. \n \n1 \nIntroduction \n \nNormal glucose homeostasis is achieved through the precise regulation of insulin production and secretion in insulin-producing pancreatic β cells in the islets of Langerhans. Homeostasis also requires an adequate response to insulin in insulin-sensitive tissues, including the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. Defects in insulin production and secretion due to β-cell loss and/or diminished responses in insulin-sensitive tissues cause diabetes mellitus (  ADA, 2014  ). Diabetes is a group of metabolic diseases in which glucose metabolism is dysregulated. Patients with diabetes exhibit hyperglycemia (high blood glucose) and deranged metabolism. Subsequent complications include damage, dysfunction, and failure of many organs, including the eyes, kidneys, heart, and blood vessels (  ADA, 2014  ). There are many types of diabetes, including genetic defects in β cell and insulin action, diseases of the exocrine pancreas, endocrinopathies, drug- or chemical-induced diabetes, uncommon forms of immune-mediated diabetes, other genetic syndromes sometimes associated with diabetes, and gestational diabetes mellitus. The two principal types of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM, respectively) (  ADA, 2014  ). \n \nT1DM, previously referred to as “insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus” or “juvenile diabetes,” is a complex, T cell-mediated autoimmune disease characterized by immune cell infiltration and chronic inflammation in the islets of Langerhans. T1DM is caused by the specific, cell-mediated autoimmune destruction of β cells, which leads to absolute insulin deficiency (  Daneman, 2006  ). The development of T1DM is under the control of multiple genetic factors. It is also associated with the impaired elimination of apoptotic β-cell remnants and environmental factors such as infectious agents, toxins, and foods that alter regulatory functions in the innate and adaptive immune systems (  Daneman, 2006  ). Activation of the adaptive immune system in response to genetic and environmental interactions is relatively common in the pathogenesis of T1DM (  Daneman, 2006; Zóka et al., 2013  ). However, recent studies have provided evidence that the innate immune system also participates in the pathogenesis of T1DM. Indeed, a number of studies over the past decade have indicated that activation of the innate immune system by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) plays an essential role in T1DM onset. PRRs include membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs) (reviewed in Grishman et al., 2012  ). These receptors recognize specific pathogens or microbial-derived products called pathogen- or microbial-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs or MAMPs). They also recognize endogenous danger signals from damaged cells, referred to as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) ( Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). The binding of PAMPs, MAMPs, or DAMPs to PRRs induces an inflammatory response within the islets that promotes the production of various multifunctional inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β (IL-1β). IL-1β, encoded by IL-1B and secreted by macrophages, recruits inflammatory cells to the islets, leading to direct cytotoxic responses to β cells (  Donath et al., 2003; Mathis et al., 2001  ). Thus, T1DM is considered an inflammatory disease of islets. In genetically predisposed individuals, environmental factors trigger the destruction of β cells by initiating a cell-mediated immune response. The response involves islet-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages as well as CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, cytokines, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (  Donath et al., 2003; Mathis et al., 2001  ). PAMPs and DAMPs contribute to the destruction of β cells by inducing a mixture of β-cell necrosis and apoptosis (  Zóka et al., 2013  ). \n \nT2DM is the most prevalent type of diabetes. It is one of the most important chronic diseases because of its prevalence worldwide and its potential long-term consequences, which include macrovascular complications (such as atherosclerosis and amputation) and microvascular complications (such as retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) (  Donath and Shoelson, 2011  ). T2DM is a chronic autoinflammatory disease in which a combination of insulin resistance (impairment of insulin action) in peripheral tissues and β-cell failure (decreased β-cell mass and an inadequate insulin secretory response) results in hyperglycemia ( Donath and Shoelson, 2011  ). Insulin resistance leads to increased metabolic demand for insulin in peripheral tissues; this precedes the development of hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency resulting from β-cell dysfunction ( Kasuga, 2006  ). Insulin resistance is typically present for a long period before the development of overt T2DM because β cells respond to the increased metabolic demand for insulin by increasing insulin secretion. This hypersecretion of insulin involves an expansion of β-cell mass and enhancement of the insulin secretory function. T2DM develops when β cells are unable to meet the metabolic demand because of a deterioration in β cell function, which is associated with inadequate expansion of β-cell mass or failure of the existing β-cell mass to respond to glucose. Indeed, studies in both rodent and human islets have shown that T2D entails loss of β-cell mass via increased apoptosis rather than decreased β-cell proliferation (  Montane et al., 2014  ). Several mechanisms cause insulin resistance and β-cell failure in T2DM. These include glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, endocannabinoids (ECs), and amyloid deposition in the pancreas (reviewed in  Donath and Shoelson, 2011  ). In addition, increasing evidence indicates that these mechanisms contribute to inflammatory processes involving immune cell infiltration, cytokine production, apoptosis, amyloid deposition, and eventual fibrosis, as well as chronic low-grade systemic inflammation ( Donath et al., 2003; Donath and Shoelson, 2011; Grant and Dixit, 2013; Masters et al., 2010  ). Inflammation leads to elevated levels of circulating proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukins (ILs), and adipokines. It is directly linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and the initiation and progression of T2DM ( Spranger et al., 2003  ). The processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines during T2DM are regulated by inflammasomes, particularly the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. Inflammasomes sense DAMPs (  Schroder et al., 2010  ), which include various endogenous metabolic byproducts, such as islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), and cause sterile inflammation ( Chen and Nuñez, 2010  ). As a sensor of metabolic danger, the NLRP3 inflammasome controls insulin resistance and β-cell failure in T2DM (  Mandrup-Poulsen et al., 2010; Stienstra et al., 2010, 2011; Vandanmagsar et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010; [6]  ). \n \nDiabetes treatment aims at improving glycemic control, which in turn diminishes the risk of associated complications. Current treatment typically begins with lifestyle modifications, with the subsequent addition of antidiabetic agents such as insulin, biguanides metformin, sulphonylureas, thiazolidinediones, α-glucosidase inhibitors, incretin analogues, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors, and sodium-glucose co-transporter inhibitors ( Bailey, 2005; Dardano et al., 2014; Donath, 2014; Kim and Egan, 2008  ). These medications decrease glucose levels by improving β-cell function and mass, improving insulin sensitivity, or providing exogenous insulin. Although treatments can delay the onset of diabetes, glycemia in diabetic patients is poorly controlled because current medications address the symptoms of diabetes but not the underlying pathophysiology. Furthermore, most antidiabetic agents are associated with undesirable side effects. These include weight gain and hypoglycemia for sulphonylureas or insulin; gastrointestinal symptoms for biguanides; and weight gain, peripheral edema, and bone fractures for thiazolidinediones (  Dardano et al., 2014  ). Therefore, new treatments for diabetes should aim to correct glycemia with minimal side effects while preventing disease progression by targeting the underlying causes. \n \nIn this review, we focus on the roles of inflammasomes and DAMPs and their pathological relevance to the development of diabetes. We also discuss current therapeutic approaches for the treatment of diabetes. \n \n2 \nPRRs and inflammasomes in diabetes \n \nInflammation is a complex biological response to pathogen-induced tissue injury and danger signals. Its goal is to protect living tissues and initiate healing by eliminating injurious agents and damaged tissue components. The inflammatory response is mediated by immune system activation, which leads to the recruitment of inflammatory components to the injury site, particularly, innate immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. PRRs on the surface of these cells recognize PAMPs and DAMPs. The subsequent activation of the cells leads to the eradication of harmful pathogens and danger signals. In addition, the processing and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines lead to the activation and recruitment of adaptive immune cells ( Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). In the absence of infection, the same innate inflammatory responses can also be activated in response to tissue injury due to trauma, ischemia-reperfusion injury, chemically induced injury, or cellular and metabolic dysfunction. This response is commonly referred to as sterile inflammation ( Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Rock et al., 2010  ). Similar to infection-induced inflammation, sterile inflammation is crucial for the neutralization and sequestration of injurious agents, the removal of damaged cells, and tissue and wound repair. It is mediated by innate immune cells such as neutrophils and macrophages (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Rock et al., 2010  ). In response to tissue damage, these cells are recruited to the injury site, where they produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, including TNF and interleukin-1 (IL-1). However, a continuous inflammatory response to persistent infection or prolonged exposure to an offending agent can cause chronic inflammation, resulting in elevated levels of circulating inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and ultimately causing chronic inflammatory diseases such as diabetes (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Donath, 2014; Donath and Shoelson, 2011; Lukens et al., 2012; Rock et al., 2010  ). \n \n2.1 \nPRRs \n \nGermline-encoded PRRs are host receptors that trigger the innate immune response to infectious pathogens and coordinate the inflammatory response in order to eliminate pathogens (  Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). PRRs are considered the initial sensors of infection. The molecules sense conserved structural moieties (PAMPs) found in infectious pathogens. PRRs are also involved in the activation of sterile inflammation by DAMPs, which are released from host cells following tissue injury or cell death. Thus, there are similarities between the pathogen-induced and sterile stimulus-induced inflammatory responses (  Schaefer, 2014; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). Five classes of PRRs have been described: (1) TLRs, found on the cellular plasma membrane or associated with endosomal and endoplasmic reticulum membranes; (2) NLRs, intracellular receptors in the cytosol; (3) retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG)-I-like receptors (RLRs), intracellular receptors involved in antiviral responses; (4) C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), transmembrane receptors that bind to carbohydrates in a Ca 2+ -dependent manner; and (5) absence in melanoma 2 (AIM2)-like receptors, pyrin and HIN domain-containing receptors that recognize intracellular microbial double-stranded DNA (  Schaefer, 2014  ). These PRRs are typically expressed in macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs), and various non-professional immune cells (  Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). The intracellular signaling cascades triggered by these PRRs, such as the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and type I interferon pathways, induce gene transcription, resulting in the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines that are important in inflammatory responses ( Schaefer, 2014; Takeuchi and Akira, 2010  ). \n \nIn addition to PRRs, several DAMP-specific receptors that are not typically considered PRRs recognize DAMPs, including receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGEs), the best-studied DAMP-specific receptor ( Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Schaefer, 2014  ). Although RAGE was initially identified as a receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) (  Schmidt et al., 1992  ), it has since been shown to act as a receptor for a number of DAMPs, including high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) (  Hori et al., 1995  ), S100 proteins (  Hofmann et al., 1999  ), and β-amyloid (  Yan et al., 1996  ). Ligand-RAGE interactions activate several inflammatory signaling pathways, including the NF-κB, MAPK, and phosphoinositide-3-kinase pathways, thereby inducing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and TNF (  Hofmann et al., 1999; Xie et al., 2013  ). RAGE is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and it is present on many cell types, including immune cells, neurons, and cardiomyocytes ( Xie et al., 2013  ). Its expression is abnormally regulated in diabetes (  Xie et al., 2013  ). Moreover, several studies have suggested that RAGE plays multiple roles not only in diabetes-related complications, but also in the pathogenesis of T1DM and T2DM. The roles of RAGE and its ligands in diabetes are discussed below in more detail. \n \n2.2 \nInflammasomes \n \nIL-1β is mainly produced by macrophages during disease or as inactive pro-IL-1β following injury. It is a prominent proinflammatory mediator that plays a central role in sterile inflammation (  Dinarello, 2011  ). By signaling through the IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), IL-1β recruits neutrophils and monocytes (  Wang et al., 1995  ) and triggers the production of additional proinflammatory mediators (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010  ). Inactive pro-IL-1β must be cleaved into a biologically active form; this process is mediated by caspase-1, which also cleaves IL-18 into its active form. Under inflammatory stress, the activity of caspase-1 is dependent on its recruitment to multiprotein procaspase-1 activation complexes known as inflammasomes (  Schroder and Tschopp, 2010  ). IL-1β levels in blood and islets are elevated in T1DM and T2DM (  Schroder et al., 2010  ). Elevation of IL-1β contributes to the progression of inflammation and the induction of insulin resistance by inhibiting insulin signaling in insulin target tissues. It also mediates the cytotoxic effects of chronic exposure to high glucose in β cells by inducing Fas death receptor-dependent apoptosis, leading to β-cell loss and failure (  Maedler et al. 2002  ). The process is mediated by a number of inflammatory pathways, including NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). Pharmacological blockade by IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) (  Maedler et al., 2002; Sauter et al., 2008  ) or genetic deficiency of IL-1β (  Maedler et al., 2006  ) improves glucose tolerance and β-cell function and prevents the cytotoxic effects of high glucose in β cells. Macrophages are the primary source of IL-1β. However, when chronically exposed to elevated glucose, β cells also produce and secrete IL-1β, at a level sufficient to exert an autocrine effect on β-cell survival and function (  Maedler et al., 2002, 2006; Sauter et al., 2008; [3]  ). The inflammasome plays a critical role in IL-1β production. \n \nThe inflammasome is a large, multimeric, danger-sensing platform composed of cytosolic PRR, pro-caspase-1, and – depending on the PRR – an adaptor molecule. It assembles in response to whole pathogens or a number of structurally diverse PAMPs, DAMPs, and environmental irritants. By promoting the autocatalytic activation of caspase-1, the inflammasome triggers the maturation of inactive pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 to engage innate immune defenses (  Schroder and Tschopp, 2010  ). Several inflammasomes have been identified to date (reviewed in Schroder and Tschopp, 2010  ). Two inflammasomes, NLRP3 and AIM2, have been characterized as sensors of sterile injury and disease. NLRP3, the best characterized inflammasome, can recognize a wide range of structurally diverse DAMPs (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010  ). Upon exposure to host-derived DAMPs associated with diverse types of sterile injury, NLRP3 oligomerizes with adaptor molecules (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain [ASC] and pro-caspase-1) to form the NLRP3 inflammasome. Assembly of these components leads to the autocatalytic cleavage and activation of pro-caspase-1, which directly mediates the proteolytic maturation and release of active IL-1β, leading to insulin resistance and β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis \nStudies of mouse models with targeted deletion of genes related to the NLRP3 inflammasome have provided strong evidence that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a critical role in the development of insulin resistance ( Stienstra et al., 2010, 2011; Vandanmagsar et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010; [5]  ). Deficiency of NLRP3 or associated genes such as Asc / Pycard and caspase-1 ( Casp1 −/− ) results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity after high-fat diet (HFD) feeding, likely due to enhanced insulin signaling. Inflammation in insulin target tissues such as the liver, muscle, and adipose tissues also decreases. The findings link the NLRP3 inflammasome to chronic inflammation and insulin resistance. However, deletion of Casp-1 in either of two T1DM models (spontaneous T-cell-mediated diabetes in NOD/Lt or toxin-mediated destruction of NOD β-cells) did not affect the rate or total incidence of diabetes or the sensitivity to streptozotocin, despite the reduction in IL-1β and IL-18 levels (  Schott et al., 2004  ). These results suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome is not required for the development of T1DM. \n \nAmong NLRs, the NLRP3 inflammasome is unique in its ability to recognize DAMPs. Several recent studies have provided strong evidence that its activation in response to DAMPs plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetes by controlling the processing and secretion of IL-1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (  Wen et al., 2012  ). Indeed, multiple endogenous diabetes-related DAMPs that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome have been identified, including glucose; islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP; also known as amylin); palmitate; ceramide; RAGE ligands such as AGE, HMGB1, and S100 proteins; and ECs ( Table 1 ). Chronic hyperglycemia, a danger signal in T2DM, leads to the NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent production and release of IL-1β by β cells, which in turn promotes β-cell dysfunction and Fas-triggered β-cell death by activating the transcription factor NF-κB ( Maedler et al., 2002; Zhou et al., 2010  ). Other studies have suggested that IAPP, a hormone secreted with insulin, is deposited in the islet interstitium, leading to the formation of an amyloid structure that promotes NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β cleavage (  Masters et al., 2010  ). These aggregates cause β-cell dysfunction and loss in the islets of T2DM patients and in islets transplanted into T1DM patients, suggesting that IAPP is an important DAMP in diabetes (  Westermark et al., 2011  ). Long-chain saturated fatty acids (FFAs) such as palmitate and ceramide, but not unsaturated oleate, are also considered danger signals in diabetes. They lead to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of caspase-1, IL-1β, and IL-18 (  Vandanmagsar et al., 2011; Wen et al., 2011  ). This in turn causes impaired insulin signaling and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice. These molecules and other endogenous diabetes-related DAMPs that activate the NLRP3 inflammasome are discussed below in more detail ( Fig. 2 ).  \n \n3 \nDAMPs and diabetes \n \n3.1 \nDAMPs \n \nDAMPs are endogenous proinflammatory mediators that convey a danger signal to the immune system ( Matzinger, 1994  ). Under normal conditions in healthy living cells, these endogenous molecules are sequestered from the immune system to prevent pathological inflammation and autoimmunity (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Kono and Rock, 2008; Seong and Matzinger, 2004  ). DAMPs play an important role in normal cell homeostasis ( Huang et al., 2014; Kono and Rock, 2008; Rosin and Okusa, 2011  ). For example, HMGB1, an abundant DNA-binding protein in all mammalian nuclei, facilitates the assembly of recombination and transcriptional complexes at the minor groove of DNA, thereby contributing to recombination and transcriptional activation ( Thomas and Travers, 2001  ). This function is essential for normal cellular homeostasis: HMGB1 deficiency leads to impairment of gene expression, and Hmgb1 -null mice die within 24 h of birth as a result of hypoglycemia ( Calogero et al., 1999  ). However, when DAMPs are released into the extracellular environment from damaged or dying cells following cellular stress or injury, they are recognized as danger signals, and they ultimately lead to the development of sterile inflammation. DAMP release is usually induced by necrotic cell death (necrosis) or unprogrammed cell death, rather than by apoptosis (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Kono and Rock, 2008  ). Apoptosis, which is mediated by an orchestrated caspase signaling cascade, ultimately leads to the formation of apoptotic bodies, which can effectively be cleared by phagocytes to prevent the release of endogenous immunogenic molecules into the extracellular space. In contrast, necrosis leads to the rupture of the plasma membrane, which can result in the release of DAMPs and the development of sterile inflammation (  Chen and Nuñez, 2010; Kono and Rock, 2008  ). \n \nAlthough DAMPs are structurally heterogeneous, they generally induce uniform inflammatory responses, including the recruitment of neutrophils and macrophages, the production of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and the induction of T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses (  Mbitikon-Kobo et al., 2009  ). Several mechanisms have been proposed for the induction of sterile inflammation by endogenous DAMPs: (1) recognition and activation of DAMPs by PRRs, (2) secretion of intracellular cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1α and IL-33, and (3) direct activation through DAMP receptors that are not typically considered PRRs ( Chen and Nuñez, 2010  ). Through these mechanisms, DAMPs upregulate inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1β, which recruit and activate additional inflammatory cells. \n \nThe growing list of DAMPs includes host-derived molecules from intracellular and extracellular sources. Their effects on the development of sterile inflammation have been described. Moreover, as mentioned above, there is strong evidence that DAMPs play a critical role in the pathogenesis of diabetes by controlling the processing and secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Multiple diabetes-related endogenous DAMPs have been identified, including glucose, IAPP, palmitate, ceramide, ECs, and RAGE ligands such as AGE, HMGB1, and S100 proteins ( Table 1 ). \n \n3.2 \nGlucose \n \nA high glucose level is a strong danger signal in diabetes. Chronic physiological increase in circulating glucose leads to progressive impairment of insulin secretion and β-cell death in an autocrine manner and contributes to insulin resistance (  Maedler et al., 2002; Tack et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2010  ). Glucose induces IL-1β secretion from several cell types, including endothelial cells, monocytes, β cells, and other islet cells. In turn, IL-1β mediates the deleterious effects of high glucose by inducing Fas-triggered apoptosis through NF-κB and JNK and/or by inhibiting insulin signaling in both T1DM and T2DM (  Maedler et al., 2002; Mandrup-Poulsen, 1996; Tack et al., 2012  ). Activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes by thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP), an NLRP3-activating cofactor linked to diabetes and insulin resistance, is involved in glucose-induced IL-1β production (  Zhou et al., 2010  ). TXNIP expression is stimulated by glucose and upregulated in several tissues in diabetic patients and diabetic mice (  Minn et al., 2005  ). TXNIP binds and activates NLRP3 in a ROS-dependent manner. In response to a high glucose level, TXNIP dissociates from thioredoxin and binds the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the subsequent production of IL-1β (  Koenen et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2010  ). Consistently, TXNIP-deficient mice show not only impaired activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome but improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (  Zhou et al., 2010  ). In animal models of T1DM, deficiency of TXNIP results in higher circulating and intra-islet insulin levels, higher β-cell mass, and greater resistance to the development of streptozotocin-induced diabetes than that in control mice (  Masson et al., 2009  ). A recent study has also shown that a high level of glucose likely enhances IL-1β expression at the transcriptional level by regulating the TXNIP-mediated activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes in human adipose tissue ( Koenen et al., 2011  ). Additionally , IL-1β expression is elevated in the β cells of patients with T2DM; glucose promotes the increase in expression (  Böni-Schnetzler et al., 2008  ). Collectively , these data suggest that chronic hyperglycemia is a key inducer of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β production and is an important danger signal in the pathogenesis of diabetes. \n \n3.3 \nIAPP \n \nAnother major danger signal in diabetes is IAPP, also known as amylin. IAPP, along with insulin, is one of the major peptides secreted by β cells. It aggregates into insoluble islet amyloid deposits. Aggregated IAPP has cytotoxic effects and causes β-cell dysfunction and loss in the islets of T2DM patients and in islets transplanted into T1DM patients (  Westermark et al., 2011; Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). IAPP promotes the generation of mature IL-1β by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome in mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages and DCs, but not in β cells (  Masters et al., 2010; Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). Indeed, oligomers of amyloidogenic human IAPP (hIAPP), but not nonamyloidogenic rat IAPP, activate caspase-1 and the NLRP3 inflammasome to produce mature IL-1β. The hIAPP-mediated activation of IL-1β depends on a priming process that requires glucose metabolism, but not on ROS-sensitive TXNIP. Furthermore, in mice transgenic for hIAPP expression, higher levels of IL-1β co-localize with amyloid and macrophages, but not with insulin. In addition, hIAPP also increases Il1b mRNA levels in macrophages and contributes to islet inflammation by recruiting and activating macrophages ( Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). Moreover, IL-1Ra reduces hIAPP-induced proinflammatory cytokine release and improves glucose tolerance in diabetic NOD/SCID mice transplanted with islets from hIAPP-expressing transgenic mice. A recent study has also identified CD36, a cell surface PRR, as a pivotal regulator of the lysosome-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. CD36 facilitates the intracellular conversion of soluble IAPP into its amyloid form (  Sheedy et al., 2013  ), leading to IL-1β secretion. The findings suggest that CD36 links the recognition of IAPP with the priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in diabetes. \n \n3.4 \nPalmitate \n \nAcute elevation and chronic elevation of circulating FFAs and their metabolites are key risk factors for insulin resistance and T2DM (  Boden, 2002  ). Many lines of evidence indicate that palmitate, one of the most abundant FFAs, induces inflammatory responses by directly engaging several PRRs, including TLRs and NLRP3, and by inducing the NF-κB-mediated production of inflammatory cytokines (  Shi et al., 2006; Wen et al., 2011  ). Palmitate activates intracellular inflammatory signaling to induce proinflammatory cytokine expression in macrophages, adipocytes, and liver tissue via TLR4 signaling (  Shi et al., 2006  ). TLR4 acts as a “sensor” for palmitate and contributes to palmitate-induced insulin resistance by suppressing insulin signaling. Elevated levels of palmitate, but not unsaturated oleate, also induce NLRP3–ASC inflammasome activation in bone marrow-derived macrophages via an AMPK-autophagy-ROS signaling pathway. Activation promotes caspase-1 and IL-1β production, resulting in impaired insulin signaling in vitro and insulin resistance in vivo in mice fed a HFD ( Wen et al., 2011  ). Additionally, it has been reported that palmitate can induce IL-1β secretion in cultured islets ( Böni-Schnetzler et al., 2009; Ehses et al., 2010  ), implying that palmitate regulates β-cell function by activating the NLRP3 inflammasome. \n \n3.5 \nCeramide \n \nCeramide, a lipid metabolite consisting of variable-length fatty acids linked to sphingosine, is clearly associated with inflammatory cytokine production and the development of insulin resistance (  Samuel and Shulman, 2012  ). Plasma ceramide levels are elevated in obese and diabetic subjects and are correlated with insulin sensitivity. Saturated FFAs such as palmitate can induce the intracellular accumulation of ceramide, and ceramide is required for palmitate-mediated inhibition of insulin signaling (  Chavez et al., 2003  ). As a bioactive lipid intermediate, ceramide is considered another danger signal. It induces an inflammatory response mediated by tissue-resident immune cells, such as macrophages or DCs, to activate the NLRP3 inflammasome in obese subjects with T2DM (  Vandanmagsar et al., 2011  ). Elevated levels of ceramide are recognized by the NLRP3 inflammasome, the activation of which leads to caspase-1 cleavage and IL-1β secretion in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-primed macrophages. Consistently, deficiency of NLRP3 in obese mice prevents ceramide-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1β secretion and enhances insulin signaling. These findings suggest that, in addition to acting directly as a danger signal, palmitate can induce NLRP3 inflammasome activation by providing a continuous supply of another danger signal, ceramide. However, neither palmitate nor ceramide leads to NLRP3 inflammasome activation or the subsequent secretion of IL-1β without the priming signal, LPS. \n \n3.6 \nRAGE ligands (HMGB1, S100 protein, and AGE) \n \nRAGE and its ligands play direct roles in diabetes development and complications. RAGE and its ligand, S100 protein, are present in the islets of diabetic NOD/SCID mice transplanted with diabetogenic spleen cells from NOD mice. Furthermore, soluble RAGE, a scavenger of RAGE ligands, delays the transfer of diabetes and reduces the expression of IL-1β and TNF-α (  Chen et al., 2004  ). Although soluble RAGE has no effect on glucose or lipid levels in diabetic animal models, it represses the increased vascular inflammation associated with diabetes ( Wendt et al., 2006  ). Recent studies have suggested that RAGE and its ligand play direct roles in β-cell survival and function, in addition to causing diabetic complications (  Lee et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2011  ). RAGE is present on rodent and human β cells, and its ligands (HMGB1 and S100 protein) induce β-cell death mediated by NADPH oxidase-mediated ROS generation (  Lee et al., 2010  ). Another RAGE ligand, AGE, also induces β-cell death by decreasing anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression and increasing cytochrome c release in a RAGE-dependent manner ( Zhu et al., 2011  ). Furthermore, the AGE-RAGE interaction not only decreases insulin mRNA levels but also promotes glucose-stimulated insulin secretion via the FoxO1-mediated repression of Pdx-1 expression ( Shu et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2011  ). Pdx-1 is a transcription factor essential for pancreatic β-cell maturation ( Ahlgren et al., 1998  ) and insulin biosynthesis (  Ohlsson et al., 1993  ). FoxO1 acts as a transcriptional repressor of Pdx-1 expression (  Kitamura et al., 2002  ). These data suggest that RAGE ligands are important danger signals in diabetes development and complications. \n \n3.7 \nEndocannabinoids \n \nEndocannabinoids (ECs) such as anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are lipid ligands of the G protein-coupled receptor CB1R. They are only synthesized on demand in response to membrane depolarization, primarily in the brain but also in peripheral tissues. CB1R activation by ECs induces obesity-related inflammatory changes and insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, and β-cell loss and dysfunction. Conversely, pharmacological and genetic blockade of CB1Rs improves these adverse effects, suggesting that increased EC tone (due to increased EC synthesis, receptor expression, or activity) contributes to the development of obesity and diabetes and their complications (  Pacher and Kunos, 2013  ). Indeed, elevated EC levels in the blood and in the pancreas are observed in diabetes and obesity. Insulin target tissues produce and secrete ECs in an intracellular Ca 2+ -dependent manner. In response to glucose, ECs are also produced and secreted from pancreatic β cells, in which CB1R activation contributes to β-cell death by inhibiting insulin signaling in animal models of T1DM and T2DM (  Kim et al. 2011  ). \n \nPrevious studies have shown that macrophages express CB1R (  Han et al., 2009  ) and produce ECs ( Di Marzo et al., 1996  ). CB1R and EC levels are elevated under pro-inflammatory conditions. Agonist-stimulated CB1R activation of macrophages also induces pro-inflammatory signaling (  Han et al., 2009; Varga et al., 1998  ), leading to the transmigration of macrophages into islets. Via the CB1R-mediated activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in infiltrating macrophages, ECs induce the production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, resulting in β-cell loss in Zucker diabetic fatty rats (  Jourdan et al., 2013  ). Peripheral CB1R blockade, in vivo depletion of macrophages, or selective knockdown of macrophage CB1R reverses or prevents these changes and restores normoglycemia by protecting β-cell functions. These findings implicate ECs and inflammasome activation in β-cell failure in T2DM. Although ECs have not been conventionally considered DAMPs, these findings suggest that they are an important danger signal recognized by PRRs. \n \n4 \nTherapeutic implications and human studies \n \nDespite accumulating evidence linking DAMPs to diabetes pathogenesis and complications, only a few therapeutic strategies that directly target DAMPs have been developed for the treatment of diabetes. As one example, in a rodent model of T1DM, downregulation of HMGB1 expression by lentivirus-mediated short-hairpin RNA or inhibition of its activity by neutralizing anti-HMGB1 antibody alleviates myocardial fibrosis and dysfunction in diabetic cardiomyopathy (  Wang et al., 2014  ). Although their effects on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and inflammation in diabetic patients are unclear, DAMPs might have potential therapeutic applications in diabetes if diabetes-related endogenous DAMPs can be selectively eliminated or inactivated using small molecules, antibodies, specific enzymes, or RNA interference with siRNAs or microRNAs. However, current therapeutic approaches mainly focus on inhibiting or neutralizing the major downstream molecules in the DAMP-mediated inflammatory signaling pathway, such as the inflammasome and IL-1β. In this context, anakinra (Kineret; Amgen/Biovitrum), humanized monoclonal antibodies against IL-1β (gevokizumab, canakinumab, and LY2189102), glyburide (glibenclamide; Roche/Sanofi-Aventis), metformin, and peripheral CB1R inverse agonists are good examples. \n \nAnakinra, a recombinant human IL-1Ra normally used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, inhibits IL-1 receptor signaling by acting as an IL-1 receptor antagonist (  Larsen et al., 2007  ). Although the sample size used in the clinical study was small, T2DM patients treated with anakinra for 13 weeks showed decreased glucose levels, improved β-cell function, and reduced systemic inflammation with no significant effects on insulin sensitivity ( Larsen et al., 2007  ). A follow-up study showed that improved β-cell function and reduced inflammation persisted for 39 weeks following the withdrawal of anakinra treatment (  Larsen et al., 2009  ), indicating that IL-1 antagonism has long-lasting effects. Even in prediabetic individuals, treatment with anakinra improves β-cell function, implying that it might prevent or delay the onset of T2DM (  Donath, 2014; van Asseldonk et al., 2011  ). Consistently, anakinra improves glucose tolerance and β-cell function and survival by preventing the actions of glucose in human islets (  Maedler et al., 2002  ). In rodent models of T2DM, IL-1 antagonism with anakinra reduces inflammation in insulin target tissues and islets, decreases hyperglycemia, and improves β-cell function and survival (  Ehses et al., 2009; Sauter et al., 2008; Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). The anakinra-mediated decrease in inflammation improves IAPP-induced β-cell dysfunction and impairment in glucose tolerance ( Westwell-Roper et al., 2011  ). In addition, it improves insulin sensitivity, likely by reducing inflammation in insulin target tissues (  Ehses et al., 2009  ). In contrast, despite a significant reduction in hemoglobin A1c levels, anakinra had no significant effects on insulin sensitivity in human subjects with T2DM (  Larsen et al., 2007  ). Consistently, insulin-regulated gene expression in skeletal muscle, serum adipokine levels, and the body-mass index did not differ significantly after anakinra treatment and placebo treatment (  Larsen et al., 2007  ). Similar results were obtained in a study of prediabetic individuals, in which an increase in insulin sensitivity after anakinra treatment was not observed (  van Asseldonk et al., 2011  ). \n \nAlthough anakinra has long-lasting effects after treatment withdrawal (  Larsen et al., 2009  ), it must be injected daily because of its short half-life. Moreover, it often causes side effects, such as injection site reactions ( Donath, 2014; Larsen et al., 2007; Nuki et al., 2002  ). Given that antibodies allow for monthly or less frequent dosing and have high specificity to IL-1β, many groups have developed humanized monoclonal antibodies targeting IL-1β and tested them in T2DM. A single dose of gevokizumab had beneficial effects on glycemic control and β-cell function, possibly by enhancing insulin secretion and sensitivity, and it reduced hemoglobin A1c levels and inflammation in patients with T2DM (  Cavelti-Weder et al., 2012  ). Canakinumab, another human monoclonal antibody against IL-1β, induced modest improvements in insulin secretion and glycemic control and reduced hemoglobin A1c levels in patients with T2DM (  Hensen et al., 2013; Rissanen et al., 2012  ). Finally, weekly subcutaneous administrations of LY2189102 for 12 weeks reduced blood glucose and hemoglobin A1c levels, as well as inflammatory biomarkers (  Sloan-Lancaster et al., 2013  ). \n \nRecent studies have demonstrated that the currently used antidiabetic drugs have effects on activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β production beyond their well-defined metabolic effects (  Donath, 2014; Grant and Dixit, 2013  ). For example, glyburide is a widely used second-generation sulfonylurea antidiabetic drug that inhibits ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K ATP ) in pancreatic β cells (  Ashcroft, 2005  ). Glyburide reduces DAMP-induced IL-1β production by preventing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, but its interaction with K ATP channels is dispensable for inflammasome inhibition because other sulfonylurea drugs have no effect on inflammasome activation (  Lamkanfi et al., 2009  ). Moreover, recent studies have also shown that glyburide prevents IAPP- and glucose-mediated activation of the inflammasome and IL-1β production in rodent macrophages (  Masters et al., 2010; Zhou et al., 2010  ). However, as discussed by the authors, it is unclear if the dose (5 μg/ml) of glyburide used in the study would have significant effects on inflammasome activation and IL-1β production in patients with T2DM (  Masters et al., 2010  ). The question might warrant a more thorough clinical study because this dose is higher than the dose now used clinically for the treatment of T2DM. In addition, through AMP-activated protein kinase activation, 2 months of therapy with metformin significantly reduced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and the maturation of IL-1β in macrophages from drug-naïve patients with newly diagnosed T2DM (  Lee et al., 2013  ). In agreement with previous data from rodents, the maturation of IL-1β and the cleavage of caspase-1 were significantly elevated in macrophages from T2DM patients treated with diabetes-related endogenous DAMPs, including IAPP and HMGB1 (  Lee et al., 2013  ). \n \nEC levels are elevated in insulin target tissues and blood from patients with T2DM (  Matias et al., 2006  ). Thus, overactive CB1Rs in insulin target tissues likely contribute to the development of insulin resistance and β-cell failure in T2DM. Indeed, pharmacological blockade of CB1R by its antagonists and inverse agonists contributes to reduced body weight, improves glycemic control and insulin resistance, and enhances β-cell function and survival in rodents and in humans (  Addy et al., 2008; Després et al., 2005; Jourdan et al., 2010; Kim et al., 2011, 2012; Ravinet Trillou et al., 2003; [6]  ). Rimonabant monotherapy also improves glycemic control, body weight, and lipid profiles in drug-naïve patients with T2DM (  Rosenstock et al., 2008  ). Unfortunately, this class of drug has been withdrawn from the market and clinical trials because of potentially life-threatening psychiatric side effects such as anxiety, depression, and suicidality (  Le Foll et al., 2009  ). Consequently, several groups have developed peripherally acting CB1R antagonists with poor brain penetrance to lessen the psychiatric side effects ( LoVerme et al., 2009; Son et al., 2010; Tam et al., 2010, 2012; [4]  ). Selective targeting of peripheral CB1Rs by peripherally acting compounds has beneficial effects on glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and fatty liver ( Tam et al. 2010  ). A recent study has shown that the peripherally acting CB1R inverse agonist JD5037 delays the progression of T2DM by preventing NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pro-inflammatory responses in pancreatic β cells (  Jourdan et al., 2013  ). This suggests that CB1R antagonists or inverse agonists with poor brain penetrance might be useful therapies in T2DM. They would be expected to lessen insulin resistance in insulin target tissues and improve β-cell function and survival by preventing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1β production. \n \n5 \nDAMP-mediated diabetes and ageing \n \nAgeing is associated with the accumulation of damage at the cellular and tissue levels, followed by low-grade chronic inflammation (sterile inflammation) in multiple organs that leads to functional decline with advancing age (  Huang et al., 2014  ). Therefore, ageing is a significant risk factor for multiple chronic inflammation-associated diseases, especially diabetes (  Huang et al., 2014  ). Accumulating evidence indicates that DAMPs and their receptors provide a molecular link between diabetes and ageing by mediating sterile inflammation. As in diabetes, aberrant expression and release of DAMPs have been reported in ageing (  Huang et al., 2014  ). In the healthy condition, DAMPs usually play an important role in sustaining normal cellular homeostasis ( Huang et al., 2014; Kono and Rock, 2008; Rosin and Okusa, 2011  ). However, the release of DAMPs into the extracellular environment from damaged or dying cells after cellular stress or injury ultimately induces excessive sterile inflammation, likely leading to a functional decline in multiple organs and in turn promoting the ageing process. A recent study suggests that the NLRP3 inflammasome is a major sensor of the age-related accumulation of DAMPs; as an interaction platform, it mediates crosstalk between diabetes and ageing at the molecular level (  Youm et al., 2013  ). The accumulation of various DAMPs induces the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to low-grade chronic inflammation in ageing. Genetic blockade of the NLRP3 inflammasome improves multiple age-related degenerative changes in the periphery and in the brain, including glycemic control, bone loss, thymic demise, and decreased cognitive function and motor performance ( Youm et al., 2013  ). These responses are consistent with the hypothesis that low-grade chronic inflammation promotes age-related degenerative changes. Taken together, studies of DAMPs and their receptors, especially the NLRP3 inflammasome, provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism linking diabetes and ageing. Thus, approaches to detect and dampen DAMPs and NLRP3 inflammasome activation might provide a new opportunity for diagnosis and therapeutic intervention in diabetes and ageing. \n \n6 \nConclusion \n \nIn recent decades, the worldwide incidence of diabetes has increased dramatically. The disease is now one of the most serious global threats to public health. As described here, accumulating data suggest a potential role for DAMPs in the development and complications of both T1DM and T2DM. Progress has been made in identifying DAMPs that act as endogenous danger signals of sterile inflammation and diabetes. Characterization of their receptors, the molecular mechanisms underlying their recognition, and their downstream signaling pathways has also begun. Thus, targeting DAMPs, their receptors, or downstream molecules might be a promising approach for treating inflammatory conditions and diabetes. However, many questions and challenges remain. These challenges include identifying additional endogenous DAMPs involved in diabetes, determining of their physiological significance, developing strategies for DAMP modulation as effective therapies, and understanding how to selectively target DAMPs without hindering their actions under normal physiological conditions. \n \nAcknowledgments \n \nThis work was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Science, ICT & Future Planning ( NRF-2012R1A1A1041352 ) and funded by the Ministry of Education, Republic of Korea ( NRF-2009-0093826 ). \n \n
3-s2.0-B9780323297387000319 Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \nKey Points \n \n• Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the most common health problems facing mankind and is a major public health problem. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimated in 2014 that 387 million people have diabetes worldwide and that by 2035 this number will rise to 592 million. \n• T2DM is the predominant form of diabetes worldwide, accounting for 90% of cases globally. \n• The pathogenesis of T2DM is complex and involves the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. \n• A number of environmental factors have been shown to play a critical role in the development of the disease, particularly excessive caloric intake leading to obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. \n• The clinical presentation is also heterogeneous, with a wide range in age at onset, severity of associated hyperglycemia, and degree of obesity. \n• From a pathophysiologic standpoint, persons with T2DM consistently demonstrate three cardinal abnormalities: \n• Resistance to the action of insulin in peripheral tissues, particularly muscle and fat but also liver \n• Defective insulin secretion, particularly in response to a glucose stimulus \n• Increased glucose production by the liver \n• Genetically, T2DM consists of monogenic and polygenic forms. \n• A number of genes have been identified as causing monogenic diabetes. \n• Close to 100 genetic variants have been demonstrated to be associated with risk for T2DM; collectively, these variants account for 5% to 10% of the overall genetic risk for T2DM. \n• Significant advances have been made in the treatment of patients with T2DM over the past 10 to 15 years, and a large number of treatment options are available. \n• A growing body of experience suggests that the use of metformin as initial therapy in combination with diet, exercise, and a comprehensive diabetes education program can provide impressive lowering of glucose with essentially no risk of hypoglycemia. If the response is judged to be inadequate over 3 months, essentially any other agent can be added. There are six recommended second-line therapies: sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, and basal insulin. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. If hemoglobin A 1c levels above target persist for an additional 3 months, adding virtually any agent not yet prescribed is acceptable. \n \nEpidemiology and Diagnosis \n \nEpidemiology \n \nType 2 diabetes mellitus is the predominant form of diabetes worldwide, accounting for 90% of cases globally. An epidemic of T2DM is under way in both developed and developing countries, although the brunt of the disorder is felt disproportionately in non-European populations. In the Pacific island of Nauru, diabetes was virtually unknown 50 years ago and is now present in approximately 40% of adults. The IDF estimated in 2014 that 387 million people have diabetes worldwide and that by 2035 this number will rise to 592 million. Of those with diabetes currently, 77% live in low- and middle-income countries and 179 million are undiagnosed. These estimates are substantially greater than predicted even a decade ago, suggesting that the global epidemic is still progressing. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated in 2014 that 29.1 million people, or 9.3% of the population, had diabetes and that 8.1 million of them (27.8%) were undiagnosed. In 2012, they estimated based on fasting glucose or hemoglobin A 1c levels that 86 million people (37% of adults over age 20) had prediabetes and thus were at high risk of developing diabetes.  1 2 3 4 \n \nThe economic burden of diabetes is enormous. The IDF estimates that in 2014 diabetes-related health expenditures amounted to 11% of total health spending on adults.  3  The CDC suggests that diabetes costs in the United States were $245 billion with average expenditures per person, adjusted for age and gender, 2.3-fold higher than in the nondiabetic population.  4  The increases in cost are driven by complications, comorbid conditions, and increasing complexity of care driving prescription costs and the frequency of visits.  5 \n \nConsiderable information is available on the factors that are responsible for the development of T2DM, and these determinants are summarized in Table 31-1 .  1  T2DM is thought to occur in genetically predisposed persons who are exposed to a series of environmental influences that precipitate the onset of clinical disease. The genetic basis of T2DM is discussed in detail later in this chapter, but the syndrome consists of monogenic and polygenic forms that can be differentiated both on clinical grounds and in terms of the genes that are involved in the pathogenesis of these disorders. Sex, age, and ethnic background are important factors in determining the risk of developing T2DM. The disorder is more common in women, and the increased prevalence in certain racial and ethnic groups has already been alluded to. Age is also a critical factor. T2DM has been viewed in the past as a disorder of aging, and this remains true today. However, the prevalence of obesity and T2DM in children has risen dramatically. In the past, it was believed that the overwhelming majority of children with diabetes had type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), and only 1% to 2% of diabetic children were considered to have T2DM or other rare forms of diabetes. More recent reports suggest that as many as 20% to 25% of children in the United States with newly diagnosed diabetes have non–immune-mediated forms of the disease. Most of these children have T2DM, but other types are being increasingly identified. Nevertheless, T2DM in children remains relatively rare, with an estimated prevalence of 5 cases per 10,000 children.  \n \nBecause plasma glucose concentrations range as a continuum, the criteria are based on estimates of the threshold for the complications of diabetes. The primary end point used to evaluate the relationship between glucose levels and complications is retinopathy. All three tests—fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-hour plasma glucose (2-hour PG), and glycosylated hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c )—are able to predict the presence of retinopathy and, by inference, glucose levels that are diagnostic of diabetes  8  ( Fig. 31-1 ). Furthermore, there is a relationship between elevated levels of all three markers and cardiovascular disease, although the relationship is generally stronger for HbA 1c . Whereas previously HbA 1c was specifically not recommended for the diagnosis of diabetes and states of high diabetes risk based on poor standardization of assays, the current HbA 1c assay has several technical (preanalytic and analytic) advantages over the currently used laboratory measurements of glucose. Furthermore, measures of fasting and postchallenge glucose concentrations in the same individual over time are less reproducible than those for the HbA 1c . The intraindividual coefficient of variation in one study was 6.4% for the FPG and 16.7% for the 2-hour PG value, compared with less than 2% for HbA 1c . \n \nAlthough the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) is an invaluable tool in research, it is not recommended for routine use in diagnosing diabetes. It is inconvenient for patients, and in most cases the diagnosis can be made on the basis of either an elevated FPG concentration or an elevated random glucose determination in the presence of hyperglycemic symptoms. \n \nScreening \n \nUndiagnosed T2DM is common. Subjects at high risk for diabetes and with undiagnosed T2DM are at significantly increased risk for coronary heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. Delay in the diagnosis of T2DM causes an increase in microvascular and macrovascular disease. In addition, affected individuals have a greater likelihood of having dyslipidemia, hypertension, and obesity. Therefore, it is important for the clinician to screen for diabetes in a cost-effective manner in subjects who demonstrate major risk factors for diabetes as summarized in Table 31-3 . Recent modeling studies based on the U.S. population suggest that universal screening programs coupled with guideline-based therapy for T2DM is cost-effective when initiated between the ages of 30 and 45 and subsequently conducted every 3 to 5 years.  9  In a systematic review of 16 studies, for people with an HbA 1c 6.0% to 6.5%, the 5-year risk of developing diabetes is 25% to 50%, a 20-fold excess risk compared to those with an HbA 1c of 5%.  10  Recommendations for screening are summarized in Table 31-4 . The pivotal role of screening to identify individuals at high risk in prevention strategies for T2DM is discussed at the end of this chapter.  \n \nMajor Risk Factors for Type 2 Diabetes \n \n• Overweight (BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 or ≥23 kg/m 2 in Asian Americans) \n• Physical inactivity \n• First-degree relative with diabetes \n• Member of a high-risk ethnic population (e.g., African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, Pacific Islander) \n• Female with a history of delivering a baby weighing >9 lb or prior diagnosis of GDM \n• Hypertension (≥140/90 mm Hg or on therapy for hypertension) \n• HDL cholesterol level <35 mg/dL (0.90 mmol/L) or triglyceride level >250 mg/dL (2.82 mmol/L) or both \n• Female with polycystic ovary syndrome \n• Hemoglobin A 1c ≥5.7%, impaired glucose tolerance, or impaired fasting glucose on previous testing \n• Other clinical conditions associated with insulin resistance (e.g., severe obesity, acanthosis nigricans) \n• History of cardiovascular disease \n• Age over 45 years \n \nSummary of Major Recommendations for Screening for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n• Testing to detect T2DM and to assess risk for future diabetes should be considered in asymptomatic adults of any age who are overweight or obese (BMI ≥25 kg/m 2 or ≥23 kg/m 2 in Asian Americans) and who have one or more additional risk factors for diabetes (see Table 31-3 ). \n• In those without risk factors for T2DM, testing should begin at age 30-45 yr. \n• If test results are normal, repeat testing should be carried out at 3- to 5-yr intervals. \n• Any of the following tests is appropriate: HbA 1c , FPG, 2-hr 75-g OGTT. \n• In those found to have increased risk for future diabetes, identify and, if appropriate, treat other CVD risk factors. \n \nPathogenesis \n \nThe pathogenesis of T2DM is complex and involves the interaction of genetic and environmental factors. A number of environmental factors have been shown to play a critical role in the development of the disease, particularly excessive caloric intake leading to obesity and a sedentary lifestyle. The clinical presentation is also heterogeneous, with a wide range in age at onset, severity of associated hyperglycemia, and degree of obesity. From a pathophysiologic standpoint, persons with T2DM consistently demonstrate three cardinal abnormalities: \n \n• Resistance to the action of insulin in peripheral tissues, particularly muscle and fat but also liver \n• Defective insulin secretion, particularly in response to a glucose stimulus \n• Increased glucose production by the liver \nIt has been suggested that the list of cardinal abnormalities in diabetes should be expanded to eight, adding accelerated lipolysis in the fat cell, incretin hormone deficiency and resistance, hyperglucagonemia, increased renal tubular reabsorption, and the role of the central nervous system (CNS) in metabolic regulation.  11 \nAlthough the precise way in which genetic, environmental, and pathophysiologic factors interact to lead to the clinical onset of T2DM is not known, understanding of these processes has increased substantially. With the exception of specific monogenic forms of the disease that might result from defects largely confined to the pathways that regulate insulin action in muscle, liver, and fat or defects in insulin secretory function in the pancreatic beta cell, it is currently believed that the common forms of T2DM are polygenic in nature and are caused by a combination of insulin resistance, abnormal insulin secretion, and other factors. \n \nFrom a pathophysiologic standpoint, it is the inability of the pancreatic beta cell to adapt to the reductions in insulin sensitivity that occur over a lifetime that precipitates the onset of T2DM. The most common factors that place an increased secretory burden on the beta cell are puberty, pregnancy, a sedentary lifestyle, and overeating leading to weight gain. An underlying genetic predisposition appears to be a critical factor in determining the frequency with which beta cell failure occurs. \n \nGenetic Factors in the Development of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nGenetically, T2DM consists of monogenic and polygenic forms.  12 13  The monogenic forms, although relatively uncommon, are nevertheless important, and a number of the genes involved have been identified and characterized. The genes involved in the common polygenic forms of the disorder have been far more difficult to identify and characterize. \n \nMonogenic Forms of Diabetes \n \nIn the monogenic forms of diabetes, the gene involved is both necessary and sufficient to cause disease. In other words, environmental factors play little or no role in determining whether a genetically predisposed person develops clinical diabetes. The monogenic forms of diabetes usually are diagnosed in younger patients, often in the first 2 to 3 decades of life; however, if only mild, asymptomatic elevations in blood glucose occur, the diagnosis may be missed until later in life. \n \nThe monogenic forms of diabetes are summarized in Table 31-5 and can be divided into those in which the mechanism is a defect in insulin secretion and those that involve defective responses to insulin or insulin resistance.  \n \nMonogenic Forms of Diabetes Associated With Insulin Resistance \n \nMutations in the Insulin Receptor. \n \nNumerous mutations have been identified in the insulin receptor gene in various insulin-resistant patients.  14  At least three clinical syndromes are caused by mutations in the insulin receptor gene. Type A insulin resistance is defined by the presence of insulin resistance, acanthosis nigricans, and hyperandrogenism.  15  Patients with leprechaunism have multiple abnormalities, including intrauterine growth retardation, fasting hypoglycemia, and death within the first 1 to 2 years of life.  16 17 18  The Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome is associated with short stature, protuberant abdomen, and abnormalities of teeth and nails; pineal hyperplasia was a characteristic in the original description of this syndrome.  19 \n \nThese mutations impair receptor function by a number of different mechanisms, including decreasing the number of receptors expressed on the cell surface, such as by decreasing the rate of receptor biosynthesis (class 1), accelerating the rate of receptor degradation (class 5), or inhibiting the transport of receptors to the plasma membrane (class 2). The intrinsic function of the receptor may be abnormal if the affinity of insulin binding is reduced (class 3) or if receptor tyrosine kinase is inactivated (class 4). The insulin resistance that is associated with insulin receptor mutations can be severe, manifesting in the neonatal period (e.g., leprechaunism and Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome), or it can occur in a milder form in adulthood, leading to insulin-resistant diabetes with marked hyperinsulinemia, acanthosis nigricans, and hyperandrogenism. \n \nLipoatrophic Diabetes. \n \nIn another monogenic form of diabetes, lipoatrophic diabetes, severe insulin resistance is associated with lipoatrophy and lipodystrophy. This form of diabetes is characterized by a paucity of fat, insulin resistance, and hypertriglyceridemia.  20  The disease has several genetic forms, including face-sparing partial lipoatrophy (the Dunnigan or Koberling-Dunnigan syndrome), an autosomal dominant form caused by mutations in the lamin A/C gene,  21  and congenital generalized lipoatrophy (the Seip-Berardinelli syndrome), an autosomal recessive form that appears to be due to mutations in either 1-acyl- sn -glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase-2 (AGPAT2) or in the seipin gene product.  22 23 \n \nMutations in Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ. \n \nIt has been demonstrated that mutations in the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) can cause T2DM of early onset (familial lipodystrophy type 3).  24  Two different heterozygous mutations were identified in the ligand-binding domain of PPARγ in three subjects with severe insulin resistance. In the PPARγ crystal structure, the mutations destabilize helix 12, which mediates trans -activation. Both receptor mutants showed markedly decreased transcriptional activation and inhibited the action of coexpressed wild-type PPARγ in a dominant negative manner. A Dutch kindred with a 14A → G mutation within the promoter of the PPARγ4 isoform, which results in decreased expression but no qualitative protein abnormalities, has been described.  25 \n \nA common amino acid polymorphism (Pro12Ala) in PPARγ has been associated with T2DM. People homozygous for the Pro12 allele are more insulin resistant than those with one Ala12 allele and have a 1.25-fold increased risk of diabetes. There is also evidence for interaction between this polymorphism and fatty acids, linking this locus with diet. A second polymorphism, C161 → T, has been linked to insulin resistance in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white women.  26 \n \nNeonatal Diabetes. \n \nNewborns may have permanent or transient neonatal diabetes. The prevalence of all causes of neonatal diabetes has been estimated to be between 1 in 100,000 and 1 in 300,000 live births. Transient neonatal diabetes usually resolves between 6 and 12 months of life. If the onset is before 6 months of age, a genetic reason is the most likely underlying cause. The presence of hyperglycemia is often undetected, and the diagnosis is then made when the clinical condition deteriorates due to marked hyperglycemia with or without ketoacidosis. The morbidity rate is high. Associated features include low birth weight below the 10th percentile (especially in the absence of maternal diabetes), developmental delay, learning disorders, speech disorders, muscle weakness especially with climbing stairs, and seizures. Some children have been diagnosed with attention deficit disorder (ADD) as well. Occasionally, multiple family members are also found to have early-onset, relapsing, or nonobese young adult appearance of diabetes, but most cases are sporadic. \n \nEtiology. \n \nThe most common cause of relapsing transient neonatal diabetes is the uniparental disomy 6 chromosome abnormality (UPD6), which can also be caused by methylation defects in this region of the chromosome. Mutations in the ABCC8 gene or, less commonly, in KCNJ11 , both components of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive potassium channel (K ATP channel), may also be responsible. The K ATP channel is well described as a key molecular switch in the beta cell that closes in response to generation of ATP after glucose metabolism. If the channel does not close at physiologic levels of glucose, hypoinsulinism and hyperglycemia result. This causes severe diabetes with low or negative C-peptide and ketosis in the first few weeks of life. \n \nPermanent neonatal diabetes is most often caused by mutations in KCNJ11 and less often by mutations in ABCC8 . The K ATP channel, composed of the beta-cell protein sulfonylurea receptor (SUR1) and inward-rectifying potassium channel subunit Kir6.2, is a key regulator of insulin release. It is inhibited by the binding of adenine nucleotides to subunit Kir6.2, which closes the channel, and it is activated by nucleotide binding or hydrolysis on SUR1, which opens the channel. The balance of these opposing actions determines the low open-channel probability, P O , which controls the excitability of pancreatic beta cells.  27  It has been hypothesized that activating mutations in ABCC8 , which encodes SUR1, can cause neonatal diabetes. Mutations in these genes that cause the opposite condition, decreased channel function, are a cause of familial hyperinsulinemia with hypoglycemia.  1 19 20 \n \nAfter KCNJ11 mutations, the second most common group of causes of permanent neonatal diabetes is mutations in the insulin gene (INS) itself. These mutations are also rare causes of young adult–onset T2DM and ketosis-prone type 1b diabetes, usually with negative diabetes-associated autoantibodies.  8  More than 200 cases have been identified worldwide. Rarely, homozygous gene mutations in glucokinase (GCK) and transcription factor genes lead to insulin insufficiency or failure of development of the endocrine pancreas or of the entire pancreas. \n \nTherapy. \n \nMany of the mutations in KCNJ11 and ABCC8 can be treated with a relatively high dose of sulfonylureas. However, it is critical that this be done after a mutation has been documented, because the protocol involves high doses of sulfonylureas (administered in divided doses and off-label in the United States for children) and simultaneous aggressive insulin withdrawal. Collaboration with or referral to a center with experience in this treatment is highly encouraged because of potential side effects and other adverse effects. There is no therapy at this time for either UPD6 or INS mutations other than insulin replacement in the manner used for the treatment of T1DM. \n \nMost of these mutations are heterozygous and dominant (i.e., each child of an affected individual has a 50% chance of having the disease). In the case of unaffected parents with one affected child, several studies have reported germline mosaicism as a known or possible cause of the presence of the syndrome in several siblings in one family. Therefore, the risk that each subsequent child will have neonatal diabetes can range from less than 10% to 50%, depending on the presence of mosaicism in the gametes. \n \nMonogenic Forms of Diabetes Associated With Defects in Insulin Secretion \n \nMutant Insulin Syndromes. \n \nThe first syndrome associated with diabetes to be characterized in terms of the clinical picture, genetic mechanisms, and clinical pathophysiology was that associated with mutant insulin or proinsulin.  28  Persons with this disorder present clinically with a mild, non–insulin-dependent form of diabetes. Affected persons characteristically have marked hyperinsulinemia on routine insulin assays. Increases in the concentration of insulin in association with diabetes usually indicate insulin resistance, but in this syndrome, insulin resistance can be easily excluded because the patients respond normally to administration of exogenous insulin. Characterization of the insulin by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) reveals that the hyperinsulinemia results from the presence of the abnormal insulin or proinsulin and related breakdown products. The increased concentrations of insulin appear to be related to the presence of mutations in regions of the insulin molecule that are important for receptor binding, particularly the carboxy-terminus of the insulin B chain. \n \nBecause the liver is the major site of insulin clearance and first-pass hepatic insulin uptake and degradation are mediated by the insulin receptor, mutant forms of insulin with diminished insulin receptor binding ability are cleared more slowly from the circulation, and this reduction in insulin clearance leads to hyperinsulinemia. Alternatively, mutations in proinsulin can reduce the conversion of proinsulin to insulin, leading to accumulation of proinsulin.  29 30  Because proinsulin is cleared more slowly from the circulation than insulin, proinsulin levels increase. Proinsulin cross-reacts in most commercially available assays, and this insulin-like immunoreactivity can be characterized as being related to the presence of proinsulin (rather than insulin only) by HPLC or by the use of assays that are specific for insulin and proinsulin. \n \nA patient with a mutation in prohormone convertase 1, one of the enzymes responsible for the conversion of proinsulin to insulin, has been described.  31 \n \nMitochondrial Diabetes. \n \nAn A-to-G transition in the mitochondrial transfer RNA Leu(UUR) gene at base pair 3243 has been shown to be associated with maternally transmitted diabetes and sensorineural hearing loss.  32  In other subjects, this mutation is associated with diabetes and the syndrome of mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS syndrome). The mitochondrion plays a key role in the regulation of insulin secretion, particularly in response to glucose. Abnormal insulin secretion may be seen in subjects with this mitochondrial mutation, even if diabetes has not yet developed and glucose tolerance is normal or impaired. 33 \n \nMaturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young. \n \nMaturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by nonketotic diabetes mellitus, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance, onset usually before 25 years of age and often in childhood or adolescence, and a primary defect in pan­creatic beta-cell function. MODY has been reviewed  34 35  and the information contained in those reviews is summarized here. \n \nEtiology and Clinical Presentation. \n \nMODY can result from mutations in any one of at least six different genes. One of these genes (GCK) encodes the glycolytic enzyme glucokinase; mutations in this gene cause MODY2.  36  The other five genes encode transcription factors. MODY1 is associated with mutations in the gene for hepatocyte nuclear factor-4α (HNF4A) 37  ; MODY3 with mutations in HNF1A  38  ; MODY4 with mutations in pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) , which encodes insulin promoter factor 1 (IPF1)  39  ; MODY5 with mutations in HNF1B  40  ; and MODY6 with mutations in NEUROD1 , which encodes the neurogenic differentiation 1/beta cell E-box trans -activator 2 (NeuroD1/BETA2).  41  All of these genes are expressed in the insulin-producing pancreatic beta cell, and heterozygous mutations cause diabetes related to beta-cell dysfunction. Abnormalities in liver and kidney function occur in some forms of MODY, reflecting expression of the transcription factors in these tissues. Nongenetic factors that affect insulin sensitivity (infection, puberty, pregnancy, and rarely obesity) can trigger diabetes onset and affect the severity of hyperglycemia in MODY but do not play a significant role in the development of MODY. \n \nThe most common clinical presentation of MODY is a mild, asymptomatic increase in blood glucose in a child, adolescent, or young adult with a prominent family history of diabetes, often in successive generations, that suggests an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance. Some patients have mild hyperglycemia for many years, whereas others have varying degrees of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) for several years before the onset of persistent hyperglycemia.  34  The diagnosis may not be made until adulthood even though the elevation in plasma glucose has been present for many years. Prospective testing indicates that in most patients the disease onset occurs in childhood or adolescence. In some patients, there may be a rapid progression to overt asymptomatic or symptomatic hyperglycemia, necessitating therapy with an oral hypoglycemic drug or insulin. The presence of persistently normal plasma glucose levels in subjects with mutations in any of the known MODY genes is unusual, and most eventually experience diabetes (with the exception of many patients with glucokinase mutations; see later discussion). \n \nAlthough the exact prevalence of MODY is not known, current estimates suggest that MODY might account for 1% to 5% of all cases of diabetes in the United States and other industrialized countries.  34  Several clinical characteristics distinguish patients with MODY from those with T2DM, including a prominent family history of diabetes in three or more generations, young age at presentation, and absence of obesity. \n \nFunctional Effects of MODY Genes. \n \nThe identification of several genes associated with diabetes has provided a unique opportunity to characterize the pathophysiologic mechanisms by which genetic mutations can lead to an increase in the plasma glucose concentration. All the susceptibility genes identified to date cause impaired insulin secretory responses to glucose, although the mechanisms differ. \n \nGlucokinase. \n \nGlucokinase is expressed at its highest levels in the pancreatic beta cell and the liver. It catalyzes the transfer of phosphate from ATP to glucose to generate glucose 6-phosphate ( Fig. 31-2 ). This reaction is the first rate-limiting step in glucose metabolism. Glucokinase functions as the glucose sensor in the beta cell by controlling the rate of entry of glucose into the glycolytic pathway (glucose phosphorylation) and its subsequent metabolism. In the liver, glucokinase plays a key role in the ability to store glucose as glycogen, particularly in the postprandial state.  \n \nHeterozygous mutations leading to partial deficiency of glucokinase are associated with MODY, and homozygous mutations resulting in complete deficiency of this enzyme lead to permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus.  42  As predicted by the physiologic functions of glucokinase, the increase in plasma glucose concentrations in patients with this form of diabetes results from a combination of reduced glucose-induced insulin secretion from the pancreatic beta cell and reduced glycogen storage in the liver after glucose ingestion. \n \nLiver-Enriched Transcription Factors. \n \nThe transcription factors HNF-1α, HNF-1β, and HNF-4α play a key role in the tissue-specific regulation of gene expression in the liver  43  and are also expressed in other tissues, including pancreatic islets, kidney, and genital tissues. HNF-1α and HNF-1β are members of the homeodomain-containing family of transcription factors, and HNF-4α is an orphan nuclear receptor.  43 44 \n \nHNF-1α, HNF-1β, and HNF-4α make up part of an interacting network of transcription factors that function together to control gene expression during embryonic development and in adult tissues in which they are coexpressed. In the pancreatic beta cell, these transcription factors regulate the expression of the insulin gene as well as proteins involved in glucose transport and metabolism and mitochondrial metabolism (all linked to insulin secretion) and lipoprotein metabolism.  45  The expression of HNF-1α is regulated at least in part by HNF-4α. \n \nPersons with diabetes related to mutations in these genes have defects in insulin secretory responses to a variety of secretagogues, particularly glucose, that are present before the onset of hyperglycemia, suggesting that they represent the primary functional defect in the syndrome. Reduced glucagon responses to arginine have also been observed, suggesting that the pancreatic alpha cell is also involved in a broader pancreatic developmental abnormality. \n \nInsulin Promoter Factor 1. \n \nIPF1 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor that was originally isolated as a transcriptional regulator of the insulin and somatostatin genes. It also plays a central role in the development of the pancreas and in regulation of the expression of a variety of pancreatic islet genes, including (besides insulin) the genes encoding glucokinase, islet amyloid polypeptide, and glucose transporter 2. IPF1 also appears to mediate glucose-induced stimulation of insulin gene transcription.  46 \n \nA child born with pancreatic agenesis was shown to have a mutation in IPF1 that lacked the homeodomain required for DNA binding and nuclear localization. Heterozygous carriers of an IPF1 mutation from the same kindred developed an early-onset autosomal dominant form of diabetes (i.e., MODY) caused by dominant negative inhibition of transcription of the insulin gene and other beta cell–specific genes regulated by the mutant IPF1.  47  Additional IPF1 mutations have been discovered in pedigrees with late-onset T2DM.  48  Therefore, mutations in IPF1 can cause a range of phenotypic manifestations, depending on whether the subjects have homozygous or heterozygous mutations and the severity of the functional effects. \n \nNeurogenic Differentiation-1 Transcription Factor. \n \nThe basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor NeuroD1/BETA2 was isolated on the basis of its ability to activate transcription of the insulin gene, and it is required for normal pancreatic islet development. Heterozygous mutations in NeuroD1 have been described in patients with diabetes.  41 49  It appears that mutations in NeuroD1 are a rare cause of MODY because studies in different populations have failed to detect mutations in NeuroD1 even in subjects with a MODY phenotype. \n \nGenetics of the Polygenic Forms of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nThe common polygenic form of T2DM has complex pathophysiology, and genetic and environmental factors play a major role. The phenotypic manifestations of the disease are also complex and include resistance to the action of insulin in muscle, fat, and liver; defects in insulin secretory responses from the pancreatic beta cell; and increases in hepatic glucose production. However, the primary defect or defects responsible for the development of the syndrome remain elusive and are not likely to be defined until more is known about the genes responsible for diabetes and the nature of the gene-environment interactions that are ultimately responsible for development of the disorder in predisposed persons. \n \nInsulin resistance is present in persons predisposed to T2DM before the onset of hyperglycemia, and this finding has been interpreted by some to indicate that insulin resistance is the primary abnormality that is responsible for the development of T2DM. However, defective beta-cell function is also present before the onset of T2DM when IGT is present and in first-degree relatives of persons with T2DM who have completely normal plasma glucose concentrations. Therefore, although there is still controversy about whether insulin resistance or abnormal insulin secretion represents the primary defect in T2DM, there is general consensus that both defects are present in essentially all subjects with the disorder, often from an early preclinical stage. \n \nIn recent years, and particularly since 2007, there have been dramatic advances in understanding of the genetic basis of T2DM. Earlier genetic studies relied either on the candidate gene approach, in which the search for diabetes genes was dictated by the prevailing understanding of the pathways involved in glucose regulation, or on linkage studies. Linkage studies involve defining regions of chromosomal DNA that are shared to excess by affected family members. Parents are genotyped at a particular marker, and the offspring are scored for sharing of zero, one, or two alleles inherited from their parents. Markers are genotyped in family members in the regions of polymorphic repeats called microsatellites or simple tandem repeats . \n \nAlthough these two approaches did identify important diabetes genes, the application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) has led to a dramatic increase in the number of diabetes genes that have been identified. GWAS use an unbiased interrogation of the entire genome in cases and controls to determine which single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are associated with disease. The development of this approach depended on a number of factors including the completion of the Human Genome Project, the genotyping of 3.8 million SNPs and identification of haplotype-tagged SNPs by the International HapMap Project, the development of affordable, high-throughput genotyping technologies, and the availability of multiple analytic tools for the cleaning,  50  mining, and interpretation of very large datasets. The genes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM have been summarized in an excellent review by Grarup and associates  51  and are depicted in Figure 31-3 . This is a rapidly changing field, and it is certain that the list of diabetes genes will increase. The following sections provide a brief summary of the genes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of T2DM.  \n \nCalpain-10 Gene \n \nThe linkage between calpain-10 and T2DM first observed by a group headed by Graeme Bell  55  was completely unexpected and was based purely on the application of sophisticated methods of analysis in a genetic study rather than on any novel physiologic insights. A number of studies have corroborated the initial observation that genetic variation in CAPN10 , the calpain-10 gene, increases the risk of T2DM, but others have not. However, two meta-analyses of all the published data supported a role for this gene in diabetes susceptibility. Song and colleagues,  56  after analyzing 11 studies, showed an odds ratio for T2DM of 1.19 comparing persons with the G/G genotype of UCSNP43 in CAPN10 with all carriers of the A allele. Weedon's group  57  calculated an odds ratio of 1.17 for UCSNP44. \n \nCalpains are Ca 2+ -dependent cysteine proteases.  58  The precise physiologic mechanisms by which genetic variation in CAPN10 leads to altered susceptibility to diabetes are still being characterized. Pharmacologic inhibition of calpain activity results in insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion.  59 60  Studies in mice have led to similar conclusions.  61 62  Therefore, calpains play a role in regulating insulin secretion and insulin action. \n \nKir6.2 Gene \n \nThe beta-cell K ATP channel is composed of two subunits, SUR1 and Kir6.2, as discussed earlier.  63  The missense mutation Glu23Lys (E23K) in KCNJ11 , the gene encoding Kir6.2, has been associated with increased risk of T2DM in some but not all studies,  57 64 65 66  similar to what was observed with CAPN10 . Meta-analyses have shown that the E23K variant affects diabetes risk.  57 67  The study by Love-Gregory and coworkers  67  suggested that the K allele of the E23K polymorphism increases the risk of T2DM by an average of 13% and that the KK homozygote is at greatest risk (relative risk, 1.28). ′t Hart and colleagues examined the influence of the E23K variant of Kir6.2 on the insulin secretory responses to glucose and found no effect. However, they did not consider the confounding effect of insulin resistance.  68 \n \nPeroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor-γ Gene \n \nPPARγ is a member of the PPAR subfamily of nuclear receptors. It is an important regulator of lipid and glucose homeostasis and cellular differentiation. Although PPARγ is most abundantly expressed in adipose tissue, it is also expressed in the pancreatic beta cell, and targeted elimination of the receptor in the beta cell leads to a blunting of the normal increase in beta-cell mass that occurs on a high-fat diet.  69  Meta-analyses of all published studies performed by Altshuler and colleagues  70  in 2000 showed that the missense mutation Pro12Ala (P12A) in PPARG (the gene encoding PPARγ2) is associated with decreased risk for T2DM (estimated risk ratio for the alanine allele, 0.79). \n \nHepatocyte Nuclear Factor-4α Gene \n \nThe role of HNF-4α in the development of MODY has been clearly documented. Mutations in this gene lead to abnormalities in insulin secretion. Studies involving various populations  71 72 73  have demonstrated that genetic variation in the region of an alternative promoter for the HNF4A gene is associated with increased risk of T2DM. It is likely that these at-risk polymorphisms alter expression of HNF4A , thereby causing increased susceptibility to T2DM. \n \nTranscription Factor 7–like 2 Gene \n \nGrant and colleagues  74  genotyped 228 microsatellite markers in Icelandic patients with T2DM and in control subjects. A microsatellite, DG10S478, within intron 3 of the transcription factor 7–like 2 gene ( TCF7L2 ; formerly TCF4 ) was associated with T2DM. This was replicated in a Danish cohort and in a U.S. cohort. Compared with noncarriers, heterozygous and homozygous carriers of the at-risk alleles (38% and 7% of the population, respectively) have relative risks of 1.45 and 2.41. This corresponds to a population attributable risk of 21%. The TCF7L2 gene product is a high-mobility group box containing transcription factors previously implicated in blood glucose homeostasis. It is thought to act through regulation of proglucagon gene expression in enteroendocrine cells via the Wnt signaling pathway. Of the common variants that determine diabetes risk, variants at the TCF7L2 locus still have the greatest impact. \n \nIn a follow-up study, Florez and colleagues  75  observed that specific polymorphisms in TCF7L2 increase the risk of progression from IGT to T2DM, and this effect is mediated through a reduction of glucose-induced insulin secretion. \n \nDiabetes Genes Identified by Genome-Wide Association Studies \n \nGWAS continue to identify variants that determine genetic risk of T2DM and to define the genetic architecture of the disease. Grarup and associates  51  have summarized the current state of the field. As of the beginning of 2014, 90 genetic loci have been established as associated with risk of T2DM or associated with metabolic traits strongly associated with T2DM. Figure 31-3 depicts the intersection between loci associated at genome-wide significance with T2DM and five metabolic traits strongly associated with T2DM including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose. The figure demonstrates that there is substantial but not complete overlap in the loci significantly associated with these traits. \n \nBased on these advances, the following general comments can be made regarding the genetics of T2DM: \n \n1. A large number of genes are associated with increased susceptibility to this disease. Surprisingly, although the total number of loci identified to date is large in the aggregate, they account for a small proportion (estimated at no more than 5% to 10%) of the total genetic risk for diabetes in the population. In the search for this missing heritability increasing attention is being given to the rare variant hypothesis , which states that common diseases are due to variants in rare alleles with large effects. \n2. The genes identified to date individually lead to a modest increase in the risk of diabetes. Persons with these individual polymorphisms have odds ratios between 1.10 and 1.45 when compared with individuals who do not have the at-risk polymorphisms. \n3. The presence of multiple at-risk polymorphisms in a single individual substantially increases the risk of developing diabetes. \n4. In the initial GWAS a substantial proportion of the genetic variants associated with increased risk for diabetes appear to do so by inhibiting insulin secretion. Few variants were shown to have an effect on insulin sensitivity.  76 77  In recent studies with larger sample sizes the number of SNPs associated with increased insulin sensitivity has increased and at least some of these effects on insulin sensitivity are not mediated by obesity.  78 79 \n5. The majority of the SNPs associated with risk of T2DM appear to reside in noncoding regions of the chromatin. Studies have shown that these allelic variations exist in open chromatin regions alternatively called stretch enhancers ,  80  which appear to be bound by proteins. Stretch enhancers across the genome are cell type specific and are located near and associated with increased expression of genes involved in cell-specific (as opposed to housekeeping) processes. Importantly, the allelic variations associated with T2DM are in stretch enhancer regions, which are highly enriched in pancreatic islets, consistent with the observation that the SNPs associated with T2DM affect insulin secretion. \nThe application of additional techniques of exomic and whole genome sequencing will certainly provide additional insights into the genetic architecture of T2DM. Such studies are under way at a number of centers. \n \nInsulin Signaling \n \nInsulin signaling is initiated through binding and activation of its cell-surface receptor and initiates a cascade of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, second-messenger generation, and protein-protein interactions that result in diverse metabolic events in almost every tissue ( Fig. 31-4 ). The insulin receptor consists of two insulin-binding α-subunits and two catalytically active β-subunits that are disulfide linked into an α 2 β 2 hetero­tetrameric complex. Insulin binds to the extracellular α-subunits, activating the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of the β-subunit.  81  One receptor β-subunit phosphorylates its partner on specific tyrosine residues that may have distinct functions such as stimulation of intermolecular association of signaling molecules such as Shc and Grb, IRS1 through IRS4, Shc adapter protein isoforms, and SIRP (signal regulatory protein) family members Gab-1, Cbl, CAP, and APS  82 83  ; stimulation of mitogenesis  84  ; and receptor internalization. \n \nThe insulin receptor β-subunit has also been shown to undergo serine/threonine phosphorylation, which might decrease the ability of the receptor to autophosphorylate. The activities of a number of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms that catalyze the serine or threonine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor are elevated in animal models of insulin resistance and in insulin-resistant humans.  86 87  Interventions that decrease serine phosphorylation of the insulin receptor result in increased insulin signaling.  88  Termination of the insulin-signaling event occurs when the receptor is internalized and dephosphorylated by protein tyrosine phosphatases. Increased activity of protein tyrosine phosphatase can attenuate insulin signaling while inhibition of the phosphatase maintains the activation state. Two protein tyrosine phosphatases that have been shown to negatively regulate insulin signaling, PTP1B and LAR (leukocyte antigen–related), have been reported to be elevated in insulin-resistant patients.  89 90  Conversely, disruption of PTB1B in mice resulted in a marked increase in insulin sensitivity and resistance to diet-induced obesity.  91 \n \nMutations in the insulin receptor are associated with rare forms of insulin resistance. These mutations affect insulin receptor number, splicing, trafficking, binding, and phosphorylation. The affected patients demonstrate severe insulin resistance, manifest as clinically diverse syndromes including the type A syndrome, leprechaunism, Rabson-Mendenhall syndrome, and lipoatrophic diabetes.  92 93 \n \nDownstream Events After Insulin Receptor Phosphorylation \n \nThe insulin receptor substrates (IRSs) act as multifunctional docking proteins activated by tyrosine phosphorylation.  94  The IRS proteins have multiple functional domains—including pleckstrin homology (PH) and phosphotyrosine binding (PTB)—and Src homology (SH) domains that interact with other proteins to mediate the insulin-signaling events. Disruption of IRS1 in mice resulted in mild insulin resistance and growth retardation, whereas disruption of IRS2 resulted in beta-cell failure and secondary insulin resistance.  95  Serine phosphorylation of IRS proteins is an especially important target for reducing insulin signaling and is mediated by a variety of kinases, including PKC isoforms and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/S6 kinase (S6K). Serine phosphorylation on appropriate residues might increase ubiquitination and downregulation of the protein, which would result in decreased downstream signaling.  96 \n \nPhosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), which is regulated by interaction with IRS proteins, is necessary but not sufficient for stimulation of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4)-mediated increase in glucose transport in insulin-sensitive tissues.  97  In addition, inhibition of PI3K activity with the fungal inhibitor wortmannin inhibited insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, glycogen synthesis, triglyceride accumulation, protein synthesis, and modulation of gene expression.  98  PI3K generates 3,4,5-phosphoinositol, which activates several phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3)-dependent serine-threonine kinases, such as PI-dependent protein kinases 1 and 2 (PDK1 and PDK2), which in turn activate Akt, salt- and glucocorticoid-induced kinases, 99  PKC, wortmannin-sensitive and insulin-stimulated serine kinase, and others. \n \nAkt kinase (also known as protein kinase B) exists as three distinct isoforms that are activated by phosphorylation on specific threonine and serine residues.  100 101  Full activation of Akt requires PDK1-directed phosphorylation at threonine 308 (T308) in the kinase domain (KD) followed by phosphorylation at serine 473 (S473) in the hydrophobic motif (HM) of Akt by the rictor-containing complex, mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2).  101 Activated Akt has the ability to phosphorylate proteins that regulate lipid synthesis, glycogen synthesis, protein synthesis, and apoptosis. Disruption of Akt2 results in insulin resistance and diabetes in mice.  102  Several investigators have examined the role of PI3K and Akt in persons with insulin resistance. Studies have shown a decrease in IRS-associated PI3K  103  and Akt  104  activity in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle; however, in some patients with reduced PI3K activity, there was normal activation of Akt.  105 \n \nA primary effect of insulin is to stimulate translocation of GLUT4 from an intracellular pool to the surface of cells, primarily in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, and heart.  106  Akt substrate of 160 kDa (AS160) and TBC1D1 are paralog Rab family guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating proteins that have been proposed to inhibit the translocation of GLUT4 to the plasma membrane through inter­action with insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP).  107  TBC1D1 appears to play a key role in exercise-regulated increase in glucose uptake. 108  Upon phosphorylation, the inhibition is relieved, contributing to the increased translocation. Although the composition and signaling pathways that converge on the intracellular GLUT4-containing vesicles to cause GLUT4 translocation are still not well understood, it appears that the number of glucose transporters in skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant persons is not changed, but the ability of insulin to effect this translocation is disrupted.  109 110 111 \n \nThe production of glucose by the liver is regulated primarily by the relative actions of glucagon and insulin to activate or suppress glucose production, respectively, although the nervous system  112  and glucose autoregulation of hepatic glucose production probably play less important roles.  113  The ability of insulin to reduce hepatic glucose output is an important mechanism for maintaining normal glucose tolerance.  114 115  Under normal circumstances, insulin suppresses up to 85% of glucose production in normal persons by directly inhibiting glycogenolysis, especially at lower insulin concentrations.  116  When glycogenolysis is enhanced by glucagon, the effects of insulin in suppressing hepatic glucose production may be even greater.  117  Glucagon increases glycogenolysis by activation of the classic protein kinase cascade involving adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and phosphorylase and also increases gluconeogenesis in part by increasing transcription of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase by means of the binding protein cyclic AMP (cAMP) response element–binding protein (CREB).  115 118 119 \n \nData suggest that the regulatory mechanisms triggered by cAMP are much more complex, with the CREB transcriptional coactivator, TORC2, playing an important role. TORC2 is specifically dephosphorylated in response to cAMP; this results in translocation of the TORC2 protein to the nucleus, allowing activation of CREB-dependent transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes.  120  In addition, CREB may increase transcription of PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), which serves as a critical coactivator of the transcription factor forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1), which also plays a role in the transcriptional activation of various genes associated with gluconeogenesis.  118  Recent data suggest that the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + )-dependent protein deacetylase, SIRT1, can regulate gluconeogenesis. SIRT1 deacetylates PGC-1α and FOXO1, increasing their nuclear interaction with HNF4A. The PGC-1α/FOXO1/HNF4A complex is a potent activator of gluconeogenic gene transcription.  118 \n \nInsulin decreases endogenous glucose production by direct and indirect mechanisms ( Fig. 31-5 ).  121  In its direct action, portal insulin suppresses glucose production by inhibiting glycogenolysis through an increase in phos­phodiesterase activity  122 123  or changes in the assembly of protein phosphatase complexes.  124 125  Insulin can also directly suppress gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the activation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase transcription through insulin-dependent phosphorylation of FOXO1 (and perhaps FOXA2), sequestering it in the cytoplasm. \n \nThe indirect or peripheral effect of insulin in controlling glucose production by the liver is twofold. First, insulin profoundly decreases glucagon secretion by the alpha cell of the pancreas through systemic and paracrine effects. 130 131  The decrease in glucagon secretion decreases the activation of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. The second important peripheral action of insulin is to decrease free fatty acid (FFA) levels by suppressing lipolysis. FFAs increase hepatic glucose production by stimulating gluconeogenesis.  132  When the reduction in plasma FFAs during a hyperinsulinemic clamp was prevented by infusion of triglyceride emulsions with heparin (which produces increased FFA levels through activation of lipoprotein lipase), insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output was reduced.  133 134  The suppression of glucagon secretion and the decrease in FFA delivery to the liver are additive in reducing liver glucose production.  135 \n \nCentral Control of Glucose Metabolism \n \nThe hypothalamus and perhaps other brain regions can sense metabolic requirements and change peripheral metabolism. Studies by Rossetti and colleagues suggested that uptake of fatty acids by the mediobasal hypothalamus decreases feeding behavior and decreases hepatic glucose production via CNS efferents.  136 Inhibition of central fatty acid oxidation results in decreased food intake and reduced glucose production, suggesting that buildup of long-chain fatty acids or their derivatives changes feeding and hepatic glucose production. \n \nAMPK may also play a role in integrating CNS nutrient supply. AMPK is activated by cellular AMP levels and therefore is a sensor of energy supply.  137  Higher cellular energy, resulting from glucose or fatty acid surfeit, would lead to decreased activation of AMPK and its downstream target, acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). ACC generates malonyl-CoA (an allosteric inhibitor of CPT1), which decreases the entry of long-chain fatty acids into the mitochondria, resulting in their buildup in the cytoplasm. \n \nInsulin Resistance and the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nInsulin Resistance \n \nThe term insulin resistance indicates the presence of an impaired biologic response to either exogenously administered or endogenously secreted insulin. Insulin resistance is primarily manifested by decreased insulin-stimulated glucose transport and metabolism in adipocytes and skeletal muscle and impaired insulin suppression of adipocyte lipolysis and hepatic glucose output. However, it is clear that disorders of multiple metabolic pathways involving amino acids, glucose, and lipid metabolism are present in the insulin-resistant individual. \n \nInsulin sensitivity is influenced by a number of factors, including age,  138  weight, ethnicity, body fat (especially abdominal), physical activity, and medications. Substantial data indicate that insulin resistance plays a major role in the development of IGT and diabetes. Insulin resistance is a consistent finding in patients with T2DM, and resistance is present years before the onset of diabetes.  139 140 141 142 143 144  Prospective studies have shown that insulin resistance predicts the onset of diabetes.  140 141 145  Although insulin resistance is associated with the progression to T2DM, diabetes is rarely seen in insulin-resistant persons without some degree of beta-cell dysfunction.  144  First-degree relatives of type 2 diabetics have insulin resistance even if they are not obese, implying a strong genetic component in the development of insulin resistance.  140 145 146  There is also a strong influence of environmental factors on the genetic predisposition to insulin resistance and therefore to diabetes. 147 148 \n \nObesity and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nThe association of obesity with T2DM has been recognized for decades. A close association between obesity and insulin resistance is seen in all ethnic groups and is found across the full range of body weights, across all ages, and in both sexes ( Fig. 31-6 ).  149 150 151  A number of large epidemiologic studies have shown that the risk of diabetes, and presumably that of insulin resistance, rises as body fat content increases from the very lean to the very obese, implying that the absolute amount of body fat has an effect on insulin sensitivity across a broad range ( Fig. 31-7 ).  152 153 154  There is a strong sexual dimorphism in the distribution of fat, with women having a greater percentage of fat below the waist than men.  155  It is important to point out that up to 30% of individuals with significant obesity have minimal metabolic abnormalities  156  though they still may be at risk for diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. \n \nCentral (intra-abdominal) adiposity is more strongly linked to insulin resistance (see Fig. 31-7 ) and to a number of important metabolic variables, including plasma glucose, insulin, total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and decreased plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration, than is total adiposity.  158 159 160 161 162 163 164  In contrast, some studies have suggested that subcutaneous fat is protective against insulin resistance.  165  The association between abdominal fat and glucose tolerance is independent of total adiposity.  166 167  The reason for the relationship between intra-abdominal fat and abnormal metabolism is not clearly defined, but a number of hypotheses, which are not mutually exclusive, have been proposed. First, abdominal fat is more lipolytically active than subcutaneous fat, perhaps because of its greater complement of adrenergic receptors.  168 169  In addition, the abdominal adipose store is resistant to the antilipolytic effects of insulin,  170  including alterations in lipoprotein lipase activity; this leads to increased lipase activity and a greater flux of fatty acids into the circulation, with the portal circulation receiving the greatest fatty acid load. Finally, the high levels of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD11B1) in mesenteric fat could result in enhanced conversion of inactive cortisone to active cortisol, resulting in increased local cortisol production. This might change adipocytes to increase lipolysis and alter the production of adipokines, which may directly modulate glucose metabolism. \n \nBrown adipose tissue has a distinct thermogenic ability to uncouple electron transport in the mitochondria via the expression of the uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Brown adipose tissue is activated by the sympathetic nervous system, which increases the mobilization and oxidation of fatty acids.  171  In humans, prolonged or repeated cold exposure can increase the mass and activity of intrascapular deposits of brown adipose tissue, as defined by the uptake of glucose, and can improve glucose homeostasis.  172  It has been recognized that rodents and humans also have fat depots of so-called beige or brite (brown in white) adipocytes,  173  which appear in white adipose tissue following cold and hormonal stimuli.  173  A defining feature of beige adipocytes is the expression of UCP1; however, the developmental origin of these cells appears to be distinct from brown adipose tissue. It continues to be controversial if these cells are formed de novo from precursor cells in the adipose tissue or arise by transdifferentiation of existing white adipose tissue to beige/brite adipocytes. The degree in which humans can increase beige adipocytes and how it may impact metabolism remains to be determined. \n \nHyperinsulinemia and Insulin Resistance \n \nHyperinsulinemia per se has been proposed to cause insulin resistance. Elevated concentrations of insulin can cause insulin resistance by downregulating insulin receptors and desensitizing postreceptor pathways.  174  Del Prato and associates showed that 24 and 72 hours of sustained physiologic hyperinsulinemia in normal persons specifically inhibited the ability of insulin to increase nonoxidative glucose disposal in association with an impaired ability of insulin to stimulate glycogen synthase activity.  175  Suppression of insulin secretion in obese, insulin-resistant persons results in increased insulin sensitivity.  176 177 \n \nNutrient Overload and Insulin Resistance. \n \nCells have developed a number of ways to sense incoming nutrients, including direct and indirect activation of transcription factors and protein kinases. These pathways integrate with incoming hormonal signals to modulate cellular metabolism, increasing anabolic reactions in times of nutrient surfeit and catabolic reactions in postprandial or nutrient-deficient states. In a sense, the reaction of different tissues to obesity may be a relatively normal physiologic response to excess nutrient delivery, with prolonged activation leading to unintended and pathologic states that result in insulin resistance, inflammation, and even cell death. A variety of interacting factors functioning within and between tissues will determine the final phenotypic response of a person to continued nutrient overload. An individual can be obese with normal objective findings related to glucose and lipid homeostasis or other cardiovascular risk factors, whereas another person can be only slightly above normal weight and yet harbor a distinctly abnormal physiology. Clearly, genetics plays a role in these responses, as demonstrated by the increased burden of metabolic dysfunction in Asians at a much lower BMI than in Caucasians or other ethnic groups.  178 \n \nAdipose Tissue and Insulin Resistance. \n \nTo maintain metabolic homeostasis, nutrient intake exceeding expenditure must be converted to biologic precursors to increase cellular mass or it must be stored. Most excess nutrients, whether carbohydrate, protein, or lipid, are ultimately stored as triglyceride in adipose tissue. This storage segregates the excess nutrients in a form that is dense and can be easily mobilized in times of energy deficit. If the storage capacity of adipose tissue is exceeded, lipids and other nutrients enter nonstorage tissues, such as myocytes, hepatocytes, vascular cells, and beta cells, and trigger a variety of adaptive and nonadaptive cellular responses that lead to insulin resistance and cellular dysfunction. Indeed, some data suggest that the inability to expand fat mass in response to overeating may be a more important factor in the development of insulin resistance.  157 \n \nAdipocytes are more than storage cells. They regulate the uptake and release of fatty acids; participate in the glycerol FFA cycle; release leptin and other hormones that signal the energy status of the body; and secrete an ever-expanding number of cytokines that have hormonal, paracrine, and autocrine actions.  179  The adipocyte itself can be adversely affected by accumulation of excess nutrients, leading to events that can have adverse consequences on the body. As adipocyte surface area increases in obesity, there is increased expression of leptin, interleukin 6 (IL-6), IL-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. These and possibly other cytokines attract proinflammatory macrophages (M1 type), which release factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) that may have local and systemic inflammatory effects.  180 \n \nMammalian Target of Rapamycin. \n \nThe mTOR may be part of the integration of excess nutrient accumulation and insulin resistance. mTOR is part of a multisubunit serine/threonine protein kinase complex, called TORC, that integrates signaling from the insulin and other growth factor receptors and regulates many cell processes including growth, autophagy, apoptosis, protein synthesis, and transcription. Two primary mTOR complexes have been recognized that likely subserve different cellular actions. The TORC1 complex is activated by growth factors, including insulin and insulin-like growth factors, as well as nutrients, classically by the branched-chain amino acid leucine. mTOR regulation is complex. In one model, in nutrient-deficient states, the mTOR1 complex is tethered to the lysosomal membrane by binding to the Ras-related GTPase (Rag GTPase). Increasing nutrients results in mTORC1 release from the lysosomal membrane and activation. \n \nActivation of TORC1 propagates anabolic signals through several downstream targets including S6K and inhibition of 4E-BP, resulting in activation of ribosomal translation, activation of lipogenesis through the activation of the sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1 (SREBP1), and increases in nucleotide synthesis by promoting flux through the pentose phosphate pathway.  181  As part of a feedback loop, S6K can phosphorylate IRS1 on serine and inhibit its activity, resulting in downregulation of insulin signaling.  182  Cells harboring tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) mutations have high levels of IRS1 serine phosphorylation and are extremely insulin resistant. Conversely, mice with ablation of S6K-1 are protected from developing obesity and insulin resistance when given a high-fat diet, indicating a critical role in both growth and insulin resistance.  183 \n \nUnfolded Protein Response. \n \nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) functions in the post-translational processing of protein, including protein folding, maturation, quality control, and trafficking to other cellular compartments. As part of its quality control machinery, when the ER accumulates excess levels of unfolded or malfolded proteins, a distinct series of reactions occurs that slows overall protein synthesis while increasing the production of chaperones and other proteins that increase the fidelity of protein processing. The RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-like eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) kinase known as PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), the inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), and the activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) are ER membrane–associated proteins that are normally complexed to the ER protein BiP/GRP78. Accumulation of unfolded proteins results in dissociation of these proteins from BiP/GRP78. PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 eIF2α, resulting in inhibition of most protein synthesis and alleviating ER workload. IRE1 is also phosphorylated, which activates cleavage of X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), forming a messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) translated into the active transcription factor, which, in combination with ATF6α, activates transcription to produce chaperones and proteins involved in ER biogenesis, phospholipid synthesis, ER-associated protein degradation (ERAD), and secretion.  184 \n \nIn states of overfeeding and obesity, evidence for activation of this unfolded protein response (UPR) can be seen in liver, adipose tissue, pancreatic beta cells, and muscle other tissues. The UPR to overnutrition is thought to have several effects, including activation of the Janus kinase (Jak) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)/inhibitor of κB kinase (IKK) pathways leading to decreased IRS1 activity, increased levels of endogenous inflammatory mediators, alteration in SREBP1-mediated transcription, reduction in hepatic gluconeogenesis, and after prolonged activation, cellular dysfunction and apoptosis.  185 \n \nInnate Immunity. \n \nThe innate immune system was originally thought to be a cellular system that allowed discrimination of self and nonself so as to adapt cellular metabolism to fight microbial pathogens. However, this system is now recognized as a general response to cellular stress that activates the inflammation and cellular repair systems. The innate immune system contains a series of pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) proteins to detect microbial motifs. These proteins, including toll-like receptors (TLRs) and C-type lectins (CTLs), are expressed on a variety of cell types, including macrophages, monocytes, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and epithelial cells and cells of the adaptive immune system. The PRRs detect extracellular and intracellular pathogen-related molecules, including lipids and nucleic acids, and initiate a stereotypical response, including NF-κB activation and activator protein-1 (AP1) transcription, which increases expression of cytokines and chemokines. \n \nActivation of the innate pathway also increases the production of so-called inflammasomes—large, multisubunit protein complexes that are important in the control of caspase 1–mediated, post-translational maturation and secretion of interleukins, primarily IL-1β, that have potent proinflammatory responses and are a risk factor for development of T2DM, perhaps through disruption of beta-cell function.  186 \n \nActivation of the innate immune system in acute infection is associated with significant insulin resistance and likely plays a role in the insulin resistance seen in obesity, mediated by elevated levels of FFAs. TLRs, especially TLR2 and TLR4, which respond to bacterial cell wall lipids and induce the innate inflammatory response, are activated by saturated fatty acids, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids inhibit TLR signaling. Activation of TLRs in cells results in insulin resistance, whereas genetic disruption of the TLR4 receptor in mice is protective against fatty acid–induced insulin resistance.  187 \n \nSeveral pathways that modulate the inflammatory response are under investigation for the treatment of diabetics. They include targeting IKKb-NF-κB (salicylates, salsalate), TNF-α (etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab), IL-1β (anakinra, canakinumab) and IL-6 (tocilizumab), AMP-activated protein kinase activators, sirtuin-1 activators, mTOR inhibitors, and C-C motif chemokine receptor 2 antagonists.  188 \n \nCircadian Rhythms, Obesity, and Insulin Resistance. \n \nAlmost all mammals have a well-developed circadian cycle that is controlled by a complex, integrated network of transcription-translation feedback loops that work in a 24-hour cycle. A defined set of genes establishes the circadian cycle, which sets behavioral and physiologic functions, including sleep-wake cycles, feeding behaviors, hormone secretion, and metabolism. Oscillations in circulating blood glucose levels persist during forced dyssychrony when subjects are exposed to contiguous 20- or 28-hour days, showing that rhythms of carbohydrate metabolism are not secondary to alterations in physical activity or food intake during the day.  189 Evidence suggests that at least some of the 24-hour rhythms are driven by a cell autonomous 24-hour clock. In mammals, the clock is driven by two transcription factors, circadian locomotor output cycles kaput (CLOCK) and brain and muscle arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT)-like 1 (BMAL1).  190 191  CLOCK and BMAL1 dimerize and bind the promoter region of target genes, including multiple period (PER) and cryptochrome (CRY) isoforms. The increased levels of these proteins promote heterodimerization and translocation to the nucleus, suppressing transcriptional activity of CLOCK-BMAL1. In a second negative feedback loop CLOCK-BMAL1 induces REV-ERBα (encoded by the nuclear receptor subfamily 1, group D, member 1 gene, NR1D1 ), which in turn influences BMAL1 transcription. Additional modulation of the activity and stability of these proteins is provided by post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and ubiquitination. \n \nThere are significant epidemiologic associations in humans between reduction of sleep and increased obesity and other metabolic disturbances, including T2DM.  192 193  Obstructive sleep apnea, which combines sleep fragmentation and hypoxemia, is a major risk factor for insulin resistance and possibly diabetes. It is not yet clear whether glucose control in patients with T2DM patients can be improved by treating sleep apnea. Recently, sleep disturbances during pregnancy have been implicated as factors in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes. Experimental sleep disruption can directly impair insulin action, alter secretion of leptin and ghrelin with stimulation of appetite, increase inflammatory cytokine production, and create alterations in other cardiovascular risk factors. Alterations in normal feeding patterns that are attuned to the circadian metabolism can change the relationship between nutrient appearance and nutrient-metabolizing enzymes. For instance, alterations in fatty acid appearance and lipoprotein lipase activity could lead to altered partitioning of lipids to vulnerable tissues, leading to lipotoxicity and decreased secretion of leptin, increasing appetite.  194  These disturbances can be exacerbated by obesity-related sleep apnea. Although the cognitive improvements associated with successful treatment of sleep apnea are clear, the metabolic benefits continue to be debated.  195 \n \nSkeletal Muscle Insulin Resistance \n \nThe primary site of glucose disposal after a meal is skeletal muscle, and the primary mechanism of glucose storage is through its conversion to glycogen.  196  Given the relatively limited nutrient storage capacity of skeletal muscle, it is not surprising that, in obesity, insulin resistance in skeletal muscle is manifested before abnormalities in insulin signaling in adipose tissue and liver. Studies using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique have demonstrated that in insulin-resistant people (with and without T2DM), there is a deficiency in the nonoxidative disposal of glucose related primarily to a defect in glycogen synthesis  \n \nElevated FFAs predict the progression from IGT to diabetes.  199 200  In the periphery, FFAs might not be markedly elevated because of efficient extraction by the liver and skeletal muscle. Therefore, normal or minimally elevated FFA levels might not reflect the true exposure of fatty acids to peripheral tissues. Increased fatty acid flux to skeletal muscle related to increased visceral lipolysis has been implicated in the inhibition of muscle glucose uptake. \n \nThe Randle hypothesis, or the glucose–fatty acid cycle, was originally proposed to account for the ability of FFAs to inhibit muscle glucose utilization. Randle's group  201  demonstrated that fatty acids compete with glucose for substrate oxidation in isolated muscle. The increase in fatty acid metabolism leads to an increase in the intramitochondrial acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA)/CoA and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH/NAD + ) ratios, with subsequent inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase. The resulting increased intracellular mitochondrial (and cytosolic) citrate concentrations result in allosteric inhi­bition of phosphofructokinase, the key rate-controlling enzyme in glycolysis. Subsequent accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate inhibits hexokinase II activity, resulting in an increase in intracellular glucose concentrations and decreased glucose uptake. \n \nStudies in vivo in humans suggest that the primary effect of fatty acids, at least in the presence of elevated insulin levels, is a decrease in glucose transport, as measured by a reduction in the rate of accumulation of intracellular glucose and glycogen using  13  C and  31  P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. In normal subjects, elevated fatty acids, achieved by infusion of triglyceride emulsions and heparin (to activate lipoprotein lipase resulting in a spill of fatty acids into the circulation), resulted in a fall in intracellular glucose and glucose 6-phosphate concentrations that preceded the fall in glycogen accumulation.  202 203  These results challenge the Randle hypothesis (which predicts a rise in intracellular glucose 6-phosphate concentrations) as the basis of the reduction in insulin sensitivity seen with elevated fatty acids. Similar decreases in glucose transport have been seen in patients with T2DM  204  and in lean, normoglycemic, insulin-resistant offspring of type 2 diabetics.  205 206  These studies also found decreased activity of PI3K and increased protein kinase C-θ activity that might, in part, mediate the effect of elevated FFAs.  207 208 \n \nStudies also suggest that PKC-mediated serine phosphorylation of the IKKβ subunit, leading to its degradation and the unregulated translocation of NF-κB into the nucleus, might also be important to fatty acid–induced insulin resistance.  209  This is the mechanism by which high-dose aspirin therapy improves glucose metabolism in T2DM.  209  Disruption of the IKKβ inflammatory pathway by high-dose aspirin therapy in a small human trial resulted in an improvement in insulin sensitivity. \n \nIntramuscular Triglycerides. \n \nInsulin-stimulated glucose uptake is inversely related to the amount of intramuscular triglycerides. A strong correlation between intramuscular triglyceride concentration and insulin resistance was demonstrated by evaluation of intramuscular triglyceride with biopsy,  210  computed tomography,  211  and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  212  MRI has been a valuable addition because the magnetic resonance signal can distinguish intramyocellular from extramyocellular fat and demonstrates the increased triglyceride accumulation within the myofiber itself.  213  First-degree relatives of type 2 diabetics have an increase in intramyocellular fat, and in this group there is also a correlation with insulin resistance.  212 \n \nThe mechanism for accumulation of triglyceride in the skeletal muscle of obese and insulin-resistant persons is probably related to mismatching of FFA uptake and oxidation. During resting postabsorptive conditions, about 30% of fatty acid flux in the plasma pool is accounted for by oxidation, and the remaining 70% of flux is recycled into triglyceride, indicating a physiologic reserve that exceeds immediate tissue needs for oxidative substrates. The equilibrium between oxidation and reesterification within muscle is paramount in determining fatty acid storage within tissue. The uptake, transport, and metabolism of fatty acids are highly regulated processes ( Fig. 31-9 ), and alteration of the balance between uptake and oxidation in skeletal muscle leads to increased intramyocellular triglycerides. The increased lipolysis associated with obesity provides an increased amount of FFA presented to muscle.  \n \nFatty Acid Metabolism in Skeletal Muscle. \n \nThe uptake of fatty acid from the serum, where it is mostly bound to albumin, is mediated by at least three families of proteins: fatty acid translocase, plasma membrane fatty acid–binding proteins (FABPs), and fatty acid transport proteins.  221 222 223  The levels of the putative transport proteins are regulated by exercise,  99  are correlated with body weight (at least in women), and can be modulated by insulin infusion.  224 \n \nFABPs are capable of binding multiple hydrophobic ligands, including fatty acids, eicosanoids, and retinoids, with high affinity.  225  FABPs are thought to facilitate uptake of fatty acids and to promote subsequent intracellular transport to subcellular organelles.  226  There is a direct correlation between heart-type FABP content and oxidative capacity observed during development and among different muscle types.  227 228  In mice that have a disruption of the heart isoform  229  or the adipocyte isoform  230  of FABP, plasma fatty acid concentrations were significantly elevated and plasma glucose was decreased, suggesting a key role in normal regulation of fatty acid oxidation. Some,  230  but not all,  231  studies have shown a decrease in heart-type FABP in insulin-resistant humans. \n \nCarnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) has been the subject of intense scrutiny for many years because of its central role in the balance between mitochondrial glucose and fatty acid metabolism, and primarily because of inhibition of mitochondrial fatty acid uptake by malonyl-CoA.  232 233  A specific isoform contributes 97% of the CPT1 in muscle and has 100-fold lower sensitivity to inhibition by malonyl-CoA.  234  This lower sensitivity to malonyl-CoA inhibition suggests that the level of CPT1 itself may be important in the balance of uptake and oxidation of fatty acids. Evidence for this in skeletal muscle stems from the finding that, as with other fatty acid–oxidizing enzymes, muscle CPT1 mRNA is regulated by PPARα activators, fat feeding, and exercise in rodents and is inversely correlated with obesity in humans.  235 236 237 238 \n \nLong-chain fatty acids, after passing through the inner mitochondrial membrane as acylcarnitines, are metabolized at the surface of the inner mitochondrial membrane by CPT2 and the long chain–specific oxidation system consisting of very long chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (VLCAD) and the trifunctional protein (TFP) oxidation complex ( Fig. 31-10 ). Transfer of the acyl chain from carnitine to CoA, catalyzed by CPT2, is followed by one cycle of oxidation catalyzed by VLCAD and TFP to yield a chain-shortened acyl-CoA that can recycle through the same oxidation system.  239  In actuality, four different acyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzymes catalyze the initial dehydrogenation of straight-chain fatty acids in mitochondria. Three of them—short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD), medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD), and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD)—are soluble enzymes located in the mitochondrial matrix as homotetramers. A fourth, VLCAD, is attached to the inner membrane as a homodimer. Their names derive from the length of the fatty acids that they process. VLCAD and LCAD shorten the long-chain fatty acids into medium-chain fatty acids that can then be processed by MCAD and SCAD.  240  The SCAD, MCAD, and LCAD monomers share a high degree of homology but do not share homology with VLCAD. At least some of these enzymes can be regulated in humans during exercise training.  \n \nUCP1 is clearly related to the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation in brown adipose tissue.  204  UCP2 and UCP3 have structural similarities to UCP1, but it is not clear that they are actually uncouplers of oxidative phosphorylation.  242  Newer members of the family, such as brain mitochondrial carrier protein 1 (BMCP1) and UCP4, have an even more distant sequence relationship.  243  BMCP1 and UCP4 are predominantly expressed in neural tissues—namely, the brain. UCP3 mRNA is found primarily in skeletal muscle and in brown adipose tissue. UCP2 has a ubiquitous tissue distribution. UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA levels have been correlated with different physiologic states, and numerous studies indicate that expression of UCP2 and UCP3 is stimulated by thyroid hormones and in the presence of high levels of fatty acids.  244  In humans, the levels of UCP2 and UCP3 mRNAs were upregulated by a high-fat diet, and the upregulation was more pronounced in humans with high percentages of type IIA muscle fibers.  245  In a small study, exercise training in humans increased mitochondrial oxidative capacity but did not change UCP2 or UCP3 levels.  246  Obesity itself was shown to be positively correlated with a splice isoform of UCP3.  247  A unique polymorphism in the promoter region of UCP3 correlated with expression of UCP3 in skeletal muscle.  248 \n \nMitochondrial Abnormalities and Insulin Resistance \n \nA decrease in oxidative capacity is seen in both humans and animals with insulin resistance, obesity, and T2DM. 249 250  Studies have suggested that increases in intramyocellular fat content in skeletal muscle associated with insulin resistance (see earlier discussion) may be caused by alterations in mitochondrial mass. In one study, young insulin-resistant offspring of parents with T2DM demonstrated a 60% reduction in insulin-stimulated skeletal muscle glucose uptake compared with control subjects, and this reduction correlated with an increase of approximately 80% in intramyocellular lipid content.  251  The elevated intramyocellular lipid content was attributable to the 30% reduction in mitochondrial oxidative capacity. The insulin-resistant subjects showed a lower ratio of type I to type II muscle fibers. Type I fibers are mostly oxidative and contain more mitochondria than type II muscle fibers, which are more glycolytic. \n \nDecreased expression of nuclear-encoded genes that reg­ulate mitochondrial biogenesis, such as PPARγ coactivators-1α and -1β (PGC-1α and PGC-1β, respectively), have been shown to be important for mitochondrial biogenesis and for fiber type selection during development.  252  PGC-1α transcriptionally activates the nuclear respiratory factors NRF1 and NRF2, which are known to be important for mitochondrial biogenesis.  253  PGC-1α–responsive genes were found to be downregulated in obese white patients with IGT and T2DM.  254 255  In obese diabetic and nondiabetic Mexican Americans, PGC-1α and PGC-1β expression levels were reduced compared with levels in nonobese persons.  256  The activity of the electron transport chain is reduced and intramyofibrillar mitochondria are smaller in patients with T2DM, and both the size of intramyofibrillar mitochondria and electron transport chain activity in muscle homogenates correlate with severity of insulin resistance.  257 \n \nIn one study, rats bred for differences in oxidative capacity (determined by their intrinsic ability to run) were described.  258  The skeletal muscle of the animals with a low capacity for aerobic exercise showed a reduction in mitochondrial gene expression and PGC-1α, similar to that seen in humans. When multiple metabolic parameters were assessed, it was determined that the group with poor aerobic capacity had several significant abnormalities, including obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, suggesting that the defects found in humans could have a genetic basis. \n \nMore recent studies have questioned the cause-effect relationship between alterations in mitochondrial mass and mitochondrial function and skeletal muscle insulin resistance. Rather than mitochondrial insufficiency being an inherited trait, these observed changes could be acquired. First, because insulin itself can upregulate mitochondrial biogenesis, muscle insulin resistance could provide a mechanism for the reduction in mitochondria. Second, the observed reduction in ATP synthesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle activity could be explained by reduced turnover of ATP in relatively sedentary individuals. Persistent delivery of fatty acids to skeletal muscle, seen in obesity and after high-fat feeding, increases fatty acid β-oxidation. In the absence of energy demand (e.g., exercise), the reduction in the adenosine diphosphate (ADP)/ATP ratio would impair electron transport in the mitochondria, increasing NADH levels, which would impair TCA cycle activity. This would result in the generation of reactive oxygen species due to elevated reducing pressure in the mitochondria. 259  Indicative of impaired oxidation in the mitochondria, mice fed a high-fat diet show a reduction in TCA cycle intermediates and an impairment of adequate β-oxidation of fatty acids marked by increases in even-chained acyl-carnitine levels. \n \nIncreases in plasma acyl-carnitines are found in obese, insulin-resistant individuals.  260  Longer chain acyl-carnitines arise from the mitochondria and plasma levels likely reflect the rate of uptake into the mitochondrial of muscle and liver. The medium-chain acyl-carnitines (from C6-C12) likely reflect the conversion of acyl-CoA intermediates to their cognate acyl-carnitines that build up in the mitochondrial in these tissues. A slowing of electron transport chain activity would result in accumulation of these intermediates. In addition, shorter chain acyl-carnitines (C3-C5) that arise from branched chain and other amino acids also accumulate in the plasma of insulin-resistant individuals, again likely reflecting reduced capacity of mitochondrial oxidation of the cognate CoAs. Although there has been some suggestion that these intermediates play a role in insulin resistance, it appears more likely that they are sensitive markers of resistance.  261 \n \nIt has been proposed that reversing the observed mitochondrial mass in muscle of type 2 diabetics may be a way to improve their metabolism. The potential beneficial effect of increasing mitochondrial mass by activation of PGC-1α activity has been dampened by the finding that overexpression of PGC-1α in mouse skeletal muscle does not improve metabolic status following a high-fat diet.  262 \n \nGlucose Influence on Skeletal Muscle Fatty Acid Metabolism \n \nAn emerging concept that could couple increased fatty acid flux into skeletal muscle with impaired insulin action is the central role of malonyl-CoA in regulating fatty acid and glucose oxidation (see Fig. 31-10 ).  263  Malonyl-CoA is an allosteric inhibitor of CPT1, the enzyme that controls the transfer of long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs into the mitochondria.  232 264 265  Even in insulin-resistant skeletal muscle, glucose uptake into the skeletal muscle is higher than normal, especially at the elevated levels of glucose found in T2DM.  266 267  The glucose is shunted toward the glycolytic pathway, generating acetyl-CoA that can be converted to malonyl-CoA in the cytoplasm by the action of the highly regulated enzyme ACC. \n \nIn humans, an infusion of insulin and glucose at a high rate leads to increases in the concentration of malonyl-CoA in skeletal muscle and to decreases in whole-body and, presumably, muscle fatty acid oxidation.  268  In the presence of elevated glucose and insulin levels, the TCA cycle is activated, resulting in an increase in citrate in the cytoplasm through increased malate cycling in the mitochondria. The increased citrate is converted to acetyl-CoA through citrate lyase and thus provides an indirect substrate for ACC. Citrate also allosterically activates ACC and makes ACC a better substrate for phosphatases that activate the enzyme.  269 270  ACC is also regulated by a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle, with the important participation of AMP-AMPK, which inhibits ACC basal activity and reduces ACC activation by citrate.  271  ACC then generates malonyl-CoA, which in turn allosterically inhibits CPT1 residing on the outer mitochondrial membrane, inhibiting uptake of acyl-CoA. The resulting buildup of LCADs and diacylglycerols is proposed to activate one or more PKC isoforms or other lipid-activated proteins, resulting in insulin resistance.  263  Support for this hypothesis is the finding that exercise, which activates AMPK, inactivates ACC, lowers intracellular LCAD levels, and has an acute insulin-sensitizing effect.  272 \n \nThe recognition that post-translational modification of mitochondrial proteins by acetylation of up to dozens of lysine residues on each protein has a marked effect to alter their activity provides a potentially important mechanism for control of mitochondrial flux and insulin resistance.  273  In general, acetylation reduces mitochondrial enzyme activity and appears to occur through a pH-dependent chemical reaction wherein acetyl-CoA is the acetyl donor to exposed lysine residues. An increase in flux of nutrients in the mitochondria is expected to increase acetylation proportional to the steady-state levels of acetylation. An imbalance of formation to utilization, which occurs in overnutrition, would therefore be expected to brake further fuel utilization. The mitochondrial sirtuin, Sirt3, appears to be the primary deacetylase of the mitochondria  274  that is activated by NAD + . As ATP use increased, such as with exercise,  275  increased electron flow from NADH to support oxidative phosphorylation will result in increased intramitochondrial NAD + leading to Sirt3-mediated protein deacetylation and increased mitochondrial capacity for substrate utilization. \n \nIncreased Hepatic Glucose Production in Diabetes Mellitus \n \nThe disposal of glucose after meals depends on the ability of insulin to increase peripheral glucose uptake and to simultaneously decrease endogenous glucose production. Although studies have suggested that the kidney can contribute up to 25% of endogenous glucose production,  276 277  the defect in T2DM is primarily in defective regulation of glucose production from the liver (hepatic glucose output). Two routes of glucose production by the liver are glycogenolysis of stored glycogen and gluconeogenesis from two- and three-carbon substrates derived primarily from skeletal muscle.  133 278  Under different conditions and at different times postprandially, the contribution of each of these mechanisms to maintenance of glucose levels varies. In studies using  13  C NMR spectroscopy combined with measurement of whole-body glucose production in normal human subjects at different intervals after fasting, it was found that gluconeogenesis accounted for 50% to 96% of glucose production, and the percentage increased with increasing duration of fasting.  279 280 \n \nHepatic insulin resistance plays an important role in the hyperglycemia of T2DM,  281 282 283 284  and the impaired suppression of hepatic glucose output appears to be quantitatively similar to, or even larger than, the defect in stimulation of peripheral glucose disposal.  282 285  There is a direct relationship between increased hepatic glucose output and fasting hyperglycemia  144  ( Fig. 31-11 ). Insulin-mediated suppression of hepatic glucose output is impaired at both low and high plasma insulin levels in T2DM  285 286 287 288  ; hepatic glucose production is elevated early in the course of the disease  289  but may be normal in lean, relatively insulin-sensitive type 2 diabetics.  288  Treatment of patients with metformin, which suppresses hepatic glucose production, results in improved glucose tolerance.  \n \nAlterations in the direct and indirect effects of insulin in T2DM appear to play a role in the elevation of hepatic glucose production. Defects in the direct effect of insulin to suppress hepatic glucose production that have been demonstrated in humans  291  appear to be caused by a large rightward shift in the steep dose-response curve for insulin's inhibition of glycogenolysis.  292  However, peripheral insulin resistance may play the bigger role in elevated hepatic glucose production in T2DM. The resistance of adipose tissue, especially visceral fat, to suppression of lipolysis by insulin is responsible for part of insulin's inability to suppress hepatic glucose production by the indirect route, resulting in enhanced gluconeogenesis.  293 294  In addition, the suppression of glucagon levels in humans with insulin resistance may be impaired, again leading to an increase in endogenous glucose production.  295 \n \nGlucocorticoid-Induced Insulin Resistance \n \nCushing syndrome and exogenous glucocorticoid treatment have long been known to induce significant insulin resistance in humans. Over 80% of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis treated with greater than 30 mg/day of prednisone who previously did not have diabetes had an increase in their HbA 1c . The exact mechanism is unknown; there are rapid effects that are related to increasing hepatic glucose production via activation of gluconeogenesis as well as acute insulin resistance in skeletal muscle, perhaps through the downregulation of IRS1.  296  Long-term treatment has profound effects, resulting in redistribution of fat from the periphery to the central compartment, increased lipolysis and elevations in triglyceride and FFA, increased muscle protein breakdown (leading to muscle atrophy), alterations in skin integrity, and reduction in insulin secretion. These effects are likely due to a combination of direct modulation of transcriptional events by glucocorticoids and through the profound inhibition of insulin and other growth factor signaling. \n \nTumor Necrosis Factor-α \n \nStudies in humans and in animal models of obesity have identified changes in the expression and activity of key molecules involved in the insulin-signaling pathway. Decreases in the number and the kinase activity of insulin receptors  297  and impairment in the activation of IRS1,  298  PI3K,  299 300  and protein kinase B  301  have been observed. Although the basis for the changes is generally unknown, a TNF-α–mediated mechanism for the decreased activity in the initial steps of the insulin-signaling cascade has been proposed. TNF-α, made and secreted by adipocytes, is elevated in a variety of experimental models of obesity.  302  The kinase activity of the insulin receptor in rats  303  or in 3T3-L1 adipocytes  302  treated with TNF-α was reduced, possibly by increased serine phosphorylation.  304  Fat-fed mice with genetic ablation of TNF-α production had increased kinase activity of the insulin receptor compared with control mice and demonstrated increased insulin sensitivity.  305  In addition, rats treated with neutralizing antisera or soluble TNF receptors demonstrated an amelioration of their insulin resistance. As described later, other interventions to decrease TNF-α action result in increased insulin sensitivity. \n \nGlucotoxicity, Glucosamine \n \nHyperglycemia is a primary factor in the development of diabetes complications, and decreases in average blood glucose have a profound effect to prevent complications in both T1DM  306  and T2DM.  307  Hyperglycemia itself can cause insulin resistance. In Pima Indians, the level of fasting glycemia is the primary determinant of insulin sensitivity.  308  The defect is primarily in skeletal muscle  309  and is related to the degree of hyperglycemia. \n \nEntry of glucose into the cell results in its phosphorylation to glucose 6-phosphate, which has multiple metabolic fates. The hexosamine pathway is a relatively minor branch of the glycolytic pathway, encompassing less than 3% of total glucose used. The first and rate-limiting enzyme glutamine–fructose-6-phosphate (F6P) amidotransferase (GFAT), converts F6P and glutamine to glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN6P) and glutamate. Subsequent steps metabolize GlcN6P to uridine diphosphate- N -acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc), UDP- N -acetylgalactosamine (UDP-GalNAc), and cytidine monophosphate (CMP)-sialic acid, essential building blocks of the glycosyl side chains of glycoproteins, glycolipids, proteoglycans, and gangliosides.  310  Evidence suggests that the hexosamine pathway underlies the defect in glucose utilization associated with hyperglycemia. Increased flux through the hexosamine pathway appears to be required for some of the metabolic effects of sustained increased glucose flux, which promotes the complications of diabetes including diminished expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+ -ATPase in cardiomyocytes and induction of transforming growth factor-β and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in vascular smooth muscle cells, mesangial cells, and aortic endothelial cells.  311 \n \nHexosamines, such as glucosamine, when incubated with adipose tissue, induce insulin resistance in fat cells  312 and in skeletal muscle.  313  Infusion of glucosamine into rats resulted in a dose-dependent increase in insulin resistance of skeletal muscle,  313  and transgenic mice that overexpress GFAT specifically in skeletal muscle acquired severe insulin resistance.  314  By a pathway that is unclear, glucosamine overproduction resulted in a disruption of the ability of insulin to cause translocation of GLUT4 to the cell surface.  315  Through its anti-insulin action, the hexosamine pathway has been hypothesized to be a glucose sensor that allows the cell to sense and adapt to the prevailing level of glucose.  309 \n \nInsulin Resistance and Lipodystrophy Associated With Human Immunodeficiency Virus Infection \n \nA syndrome with many of the clinical and metabolic features of insulin resistance is increasingly being recognized in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.  316  A cohort study of over 3800 patients showed nearly a doubling in the prevalence of T2DM in HIV versus non-HIV patients, and a significant portion of the increase may be related to protease inhibitor treatment used to treat chronic HIV. Moreover, the HIV-infected patients had a 75% increase in the risk for acute myocardial infarction (MI) compared with noninfected patients, again related to protease inhibitor use. Other contributing factors to cardiometabolic risk are male sex, diagnosis of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), responsiveness to antiretroviral treatment, and increases in CD4 T-cell counts.  317 \n \nAn unusual form of lipodystrophy is observed in these patients in whom there is significant fat redistribution from the extremities and face to the torso with accumulation of intra-abdominal and intrascapular fat. This form of lipodystrophy is associated with significant insulin resistance and T2DM, dyslipidemia with elevated total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and suppressed HDL-cholesterol concentrations and a susceptibility to lactic acidemia.  318  Administration of ritonavir to normal subjects caused increases in plasma triglyceride and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol and decreased plasma HDL-cholesterol levels.  319  Indinavir administration for 4 weeks resulted in small increases in serum glucose and insulin levels and decreased insulin-mediated glucose disposal as assessed with a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp; there were no changes in lipoprotein, triglyceride, or FFA levels.  320 \n \nThe molecular basis of the metabolic syndrome is not clear. A number of protease inhibitors can inhibit glucose transport in vitro and in vivo, and there is evidence for a direct interaction with GLUT4  321  that could inhibit glucose uptake specifically in insulin-responsive tissue. Mitochondrial abnormalities have been described in subcutaneous adipose tissue biopsy specimens obtained from HIV-infected patients with lipodystrophy compared with specimens from patients without the syndrome.  322  A direct effect of protease inhibitors on differentiation of adipocytes has also been described.  323 324 325  Additionally, reductions in mitochondrial number and oxidative function have been described in adipocytes from subcutaneous biopsies obtained from patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).  326  The precise mechanism for the lipodystrophy associated with HIV infection is not known. \n \nTreatment of HIV-associated lipodystrophy continues to be inadequate. Use of newer protease inhibitors might improve metabolic abnormalities, particularly those induced or increased by protease inhibitor therapy. However, changing protease inhibitors has little impact on body fat. Switching thymidine analogues has been the only intervention to improve lipoatrophy in independent studies.  327  Insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones have shown mixed results, with improvement in insulin sensitivity but little alteration in fat distribution.  328  More than 75% of patients with HIV who have acute MI are older than 55 years of age. Because of the increased risk of cardiovascular disease, treatment of hyperlipidemia is essential in these patients, with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates, alone or in combination, as first-line drugs.  329 330 \n \nMeasures to Improve Insulin Sensitivity \n \nMechanisms of Reducing Insulin Resistance \n \nThe most effective measures to improve insulin sensitivity are weight loss and exercise. Both modalities are effective and can be additive in their ability to improve insulin action. Later in this chapter, the roles of these interventions in the treatment of patients with T2DM are discussed. The scientific basis and molecular mechanisms responsible for the improvements in insulin sensitivity seen with these interventions are summarized in the following paragraphs. \n \nMechanisms for Improved Insulin Sensitivity With Weight Loss \n \nWeight loss can be a highly effective treatment for overweight patients with T2DM and other cardiovascular risk factors, and it is advocated as the first line of therapy. Weight loss also plays an important role in preventing T2DM.  152 331  In overweight patients with T2DM, weight loss can reduce hepatic glucose production, insulin resistance, and fasting hyperinsulinemia and can improve glycemic control. Weight loss in T2DM is also associated with a reduction in blood pressure and an improvement in the lipid profile. These benefits can occur with as little as 5% to 10% weight loss.  332 333 334  Moreover, preventing obesity in primates with long-term caloric restriction attenuates the development of insulin resistance. \n \nThe likely mechanism for improvements in insulin sensitivity through weight loss is the reduction in nutrient flux into tissues, reversing many of the cellular mechanisms that are triggered that protect individual cells from nutrient excess. Restriction of calories has a profound and immediate effect on improvement in insulin sensitivity even before change in weight.  335  There are clearly effects on the pattern of muscle fatty acid metabolism and the accumulation of lipid within muscle following weight loss.  263 264  Hepatic glucose production is markedly reduced,  336  as is adipose tissue lipolysis.  337  The improvement in insulin resistance and the reversal of T2DM following bariatric surgery are gaining interest because of the long-term success of the intervention. Although some have speculated that the improvement in insulin action and insulin secretion following bariatric surgery may be through overlapping, but distinct, mechanisms,  338  there is evidence that the effects may be similar, at least in the short term, mediated entirely by reduction in caloric intake.  339  The remission of T2DM is sustained for a longer period of time with surgery than medically induced weight loss, but this effect is likely to be due to sustained reduction in weight. \n \nMechanisms for Improved Insulin Sensitivity With Exercise \n \nExercise is clearly effective in increasing insulin sensitivity in animals and humans. There appear to be two separate but related effects of exercise on insulin action. A single bout of exercise can result in an acute increase in insulin-independent glucose transport that is measurable during and for a relatively short period after exercise.  340 341 342 343 344  Like insulin, exercise and muscle contractions increase glucose transport by translocation of intracellular GLUT4 to the cell surface and promote storage as glycogen.  345 346 347 \n \nAcute Exercise \n \nThe signaling pathway leading to the exercise-induced increase in glucose transporter translocation and glucose transport is unknown, although there is ample evidence that the pathway is independent of the insulin-stimulated, receptor-mediated pathway. The effect of exercise and contractions on translocation and transport is additive to the maximal effect of insulin.  340 347 348 349 350  Insulin-stimulated glucose transport in muscle is inhibited by specific inhibitors of PI3K, such as wortmannin, whereas transport or translocation stimulated by muscle contractions is insen­sitive to these inhibitors.  347 348 349 350 351 352  Stimulation of muscle contractions in situ and exercise do not increase insulin receptor phosphorylation, tyrosine kinase activity, IRS phosphorylation, or PI3K activity.  346 353  In addition, in many insulin-resistant states, the acute exercise–stimulated (but not insulin-stimulated) glucose transport and GLUT4 translocation are normal. This has been demonstrated in the obese, insulin-resistant Zucker rat  354  and in patients with T2DM.  111  Finally, hypoxia, a stimulus for glucose transport that is also independent of the insulin receptor–mediated pathway, is effective in increasing glucose transport in muscle strips from obese, insulin-resistant patients and in patients with T2DM.  355 \n \nThe acute effect of exercise and hypoxia may be mediated by AMPK. AMPK is thought to be a sensor of intracellular energy stores and is activated by increases in intracellular AMP. A stable AMP analogue, 5-amino-4-imidazole carboxamide ribotide (ZMP), can be generated intracellularly from 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleoside (AICAR) and can activate AMPK in cells, leading to increased phosphorylation of known substrates for AMPK, including HMG-CoA reductase, acyl-CoA carboxylase, and creatine kinase.  356  Treatment of incubated skeletal muscle with AICAR resulted in increased glucose uptake and glucose transporter translocation.  357  Similarly, the inclusion of 2 mmol/L of AICAR in the perfusate of the rat hindlimb resulted in inactivation of ACC, decreases in malonyl-CoA levels, and a twofold increase in glucose uptake.  358 359 \n \nThe euglycemic clamp technique was used in conscious rats to demonstrate that infusion of AICAR results in a greater than twofold increase in glucose utilization.  360  Uptake of the glucose analogue 2-deoxyglucose was also increased twofold in vivo in soleus and gastrocnemius muscles. As with previous studies, this uptake was not associated with PI3K activation, again indicating a separate pathway from that of insulin. \n \nA second effect of exercise, which becomes evident as the acute effect on glucose transport reverses, is a large increase in the sensitivity of glucose transport to stimulation by insulin.  361 362 363 364  This effect is due to translocation of a greater amount of GLUT4 to the cell surface for any given dose of insulin.  365 366  As with the acute stimulation of transport by exercise, the cellular mechanisms leading to enhanced translocation in response to submaximally effective stimuli are unknown. However, several studies have shown that steps in the insulin-signaling cascade leading to activation of PI3K are not enhanced after a bout of exercise. There is no change in insulin binding to its receptor,  353 367  insulin stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase activity,  353 368  increased insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1,  365  or PI3K activity associated with IRS1.  346 368 \n \nExercise Training \n \nExercise training also results in increases in insulin sensitivity  369 370  and can delay or prevent the onset of T2DM in those at high risk.  371  Using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp, Perseghin and coworkers  372  compared exercise training for 45 minutes on a stair-climbing machine 4 days per week for 6 weeks in normal insulin-sensitive subjects and a group of high-risk, insulin-resistant relatives of T2DM. A 100% increase in insulin sensitivity was seen in both groups without a significant change in body weight. The higher basal and glucose-stimulated insulin release seen in the insulin-resistant subjects was not altered after exercise training. The effect of exercise training on insulin sensitivity has been proposed to be caused by upregulation. \n \nPrimary effects of exercise training include increased glucose transporter number, changes in capillary density, increased number of red glycolytic (type IIa) fibers, and increased density of mitochondria.  373 374  A reduction in mitochondrial oxidative capacity could underlie the dysregulation of lipid metabolism that results in reduced skeletal muscle glucose metabolism. Expression of nuclear-encoded genes that regulate mitochondrial biogenesis, such as the NRFs, PGC-1α, and PGC-1β, have been shown to be important for both mitochondrial biogenesis and fiber-type selection during development.  252 375  In muscle-specific transgenic mice, PGC-1α promotes muscle fiber-type switching from fast-twitch glycolytic fibers (types IIa and IIb) to slow-twitch oxidative fibers (type I), increases mitochondrial density, and improves oxidative capacity.  376  These changes are also observed after exercise training. \n \nMany of the changes observed after exercise are likely to be mediated in part through PGC-1α levels and activity. Exercise-induced expression of PGC-1α in skeletal muscle is thought to be mediated by myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2),  377  possibly through its interaction with MEF2C  378  and CREB.  377  PGC-1α regulates its own promoter activity in a positive autoregulation loop. Activation of estrogen-related receptor α (ERRα) and GA repeat–binding protein-α (Gabpa) by PGC-1α appears to mediate much of the effect to increase oxidative phosphorylation gene expression in muscle.  254  Nitric oxide produced by endothelial nitric oxide synthase controls mitochondrial biogenesis,  379  possibly through increased expression of PGC-1α and other transcription factors. This process is mediated by cyclic guanosine 3′,5′-phosphate, resulting from activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. \n \nThe pathway from exercise to activation of PGC-1α has been partially elucidated. Increases in calcium levels activate calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV) and calcineurin. Activated CaMKIV phosphorylates CREB, which increases transcription at CREB-responsive elements in the PGC-1α promoter.  380  Exercise also increases PGC-1α activity via phosphorylation through p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase.  381 382  AMPK, which is activated by exercise-induced changes in AMP levels, also increases mitochondrial biogenesis and PGC-1α activity in skeletal muscle,  383 384 385  but at present there is no evidence that PGC-1α is an AMPK substrate. Other conditions that induce mitochondrial biogenesis also increase PGC-1α promoter activity. \n \nMechanisms that Link Cardiovascular Disease and Insulin Resistance \n \nThe Metabolic Syndrome \n \nMI, stroke, or nonischemic cardiovascular disease is the cause of death in up to 80% of patients with T2DM. Independent of other risk factors, T2DM increases the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and fatality but also provides a synergistic interaction with other risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.  386  In a Finnish population, diabetes increased the risk of MI fivefold,  387  and insulin resistance, as measured by elevated fasting insulin levels, increased the risk of death from heart disease.  388  Women are particularly vulnerable to the cardiovascular effects of T2DM because they appear to lose the protective effects of estrogen in the premenopausal period.  389 390 \n \nA constellation of metabolic derangements often seen in patients with insulin resistance and T2DM are individually associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. These metabolic derangements have been variously designated syndrome X ; the dysmetabolic syndrome ; hypertension, obesity, non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), dyslipidemia, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (HONDA) ; and the deadly quartet .  391 392  The syndrome has also been associated with easily oxidized, small LDL particles; heightened blood-clotting activity (e.g., increased PAI-1); and elevated serum uric acid concentrations. The proposed central abnormality associated with the metabolic syndrome is insulin resistance. Some of the abnormalities themselves have also been proposed to contribute to insulin resistance. \n \nControversy surrounding the metabolic syndrome has called attention to the question the clustering of cardiovascular risk factors such as central obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension and the association of this clustering with the risk of developing diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The controversy largely focuses on the cause of the syndrome, how best to define its presence, how clinical decision making should be modified based on those definitions, and whether there are not more effective ways to screen for diabetes and cardiovascular risk. 393 \n \nPerhaps the overriding risk factor for coronary artery disease in insulin resistance and T2DM is the associated dyslipidemia. The profile includes hypertriglyceridemia, low plasma HDL, and small, dense LDL particle concen­trations. The percentage of men with T2DM who have abnormal cholesterol levels is not different from that of nondiabetic men. However, diabetic women, compared with nondiabetic women, have almost double the rate of hypercholesterolemia  394  and greater changes in other lipid parameters that increase the risk of cardiovascular disease ( Fig. 31-12 ). The physiologic basis for this abnormal lipid profile appears to be overproduction of apolipoprotein B–containing VLDL particles. Production of apolipoprotein B by the liver is primarily post-translational  395  and is augmented by insulin and by the increased availability of FFAs in the portal circulation, 396 397 398 399 400  probably as a result of increased lipolysis in the visceral adipose tissue.  401 402 403  Part of the post-translational regulation may be due to insulin– and fatty acid–mediated increases in microsomal triglyceride transfer protein levels that catalyze the transfer of lipids to apolipoprotein B and decrease the ubiquitination-dependent degradation of apolipoprotein B.  \n \nThe overproduction of VLDL triglyceride results in increased transfer of VLDL triglyceride to HDL particles in exchange for HDL-cholesterol esters mediated by the cholesterol ester transfer protein.  407  The triglyceride-rich HDL is hydrolyzed by hepatic lipase; this leads to the generation of small HDL, which is degraded more readily by the kidney, resulting in low HDL levels in serum. Cholesterol ester transfer protein–mediated exchange of VLDL triglyceride for LDL-cholesterol esters and subsequent triglyceride hydrolysis by hepatic lipase probably result in generation of the small, dense LDL particles found in insulin-resistant subjects.  408 409 410 411 \n \nThe increased risk of heart disease in patients with diabetes has prompted the recommendation that persons with diabetes be treated for their dyslipidemia as aggressively as persons who have had a previous MI. In addition, patients with the metabolic syndrome of insulin resistance and obesity are considered to be in a higher risk category and should also be aggressively treated to lower lipids.  412 \n \nThe presence of hypertension and overt diabetes doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease. Defects in vasodi­lation and alterations in blood flow may provide a link to hypertension in insulin-resistant subjects. The normal vasodilative response of insulin is disrupted in obese, insulin-resistant, and diabetic persons,  413  perhaps through insulin's inability to increase the production of the potent vasodilator nitric oxide by endothelial cells.  414 415  The defect may be magnified by increases in plasma FFAs.  416  Other proposed mechanisms for insulin resistance leading to hypertension are activation of the sympathetic nervous system by insulin  417 418 419  and the intrinsic ability of insulin to cause salt and water resorption in the kidney, resulting in expanded plasma volume.  420 421 422 \n \nHypertension itself, independent of other risk factors, has been associated with the propensity to become diabetic.  423  A prospective cohort study found that T2DM was almost 2.5 times more likely to develop in subjects with hypertension than in subjects with normal blood pressure.  424  A possible mechanism is that an intrinsic defect in vasodilation might contribute to insulin resistance by decreasing the surface area of the vasculature perfusing skeletal muscle, decreasing the efficiency of glucose uptake.  416  Conversely, vasodilative agents might improve glucose uptake and might even prevent the onset of diabetes, as has been observed with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy.  425 \n \nSeveral factors involved in clotting and fibrinolysis, including fibrinogen, factor VII, and PAI-1, have been shown to be increased in persons with insulin resistance.  426 427 428 429 430 431  PAI-1 has been extensively studied, and there is a clear relationship between elevated PAI-1 levels and risk of coronary artery disease.  432  Insulin increased PAI-1 expression in hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and abdominal adipose tissue,  433 434 435  and insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones decreased PAI-1 activity.  436 \n \nUpper-body rather than lower-body obesity (the apple rather than the pear shape) is highly correlated with insulin resistance and risk for T2DM. Therefore, the anatomic distribution of fat, rather than the overall degree of obesity, appears to determine risk for the metabolic syndrome. The reported association between increased abdominal (upper-body) fat and an increased risk of coronary heart disease is related to visceral fat, for which the waist-to-hip ratio is a convenient index. A waist-to-hip ratio greater than 1.0 in men or greater than 0.8 in women indicates abdominal obesity.  437  The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) has suggested that a waist circumference greater than 40 inches (101.5 cm) in men or greater than 35 inches (89 cm) in women is a marker for the metabolic syndrome.  438 \n \nInsulin Secretion \n \nNormal insulin secretory function is essential for maintaining normal glucose tolerance, and abnormal insulin secretion is invariably present in patients with T2DM. In this section, the physiology of normal insulin and the alterations that are present in persons with T2DM are reviewed. \n \nQuantitation of Beta-Cell Function \n \nThe measurement of peripheral insulin concentrations by radioimmunoassay is still the most widely used method for quantifying beta-cell functions in vivo.  439  Although this approach provides valuable information, it is limited because 50% to 60% of the insulin produced by the pancreas is extracted by the liver without ever reaching the systemic circulation.  440 441  The standard radioimmunoassay for measuring insulin concentrations is also unable to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous insulin, making it ineffective as a measure of endogenous beta-cell reserve in the insulin-treated diabetic patient. Anti-insulin antibodies that may be present in patients treated with insulin interfere with the insulin radioimmunoassay, making insulin measurements in insulin-treated patients inaccurate. Conventional insulin radioimmunoassays are also unable to distinguish between levels of circulating proinsulin and true levels of circulating insulin. \n \nInsulin is derived from a single-chain precursor, proinsulin.  442  Within the Golgi apparatus of the pancreatic beta cell, proinsulin is cleaved by convertases to form insulin, C peptide, and two pairs of basic amino acids. Insulin is subsequently released into the circulation at concentrations equimolar with those of C peptide.  443 444  In addition, small amounts of intact proinsulin and proinsulin conversion intermediates are released. Proinsulin and its related conversion intermediates can be detected in the circulation, where they constitute 20% of the total circulating insulin-like immunoreactivity.  445  In vivo, proinsulin has a biologic potency that is only about 10% of that of insulin,  446 447  and the potency of split proinsulin intermediates is between that of proinsulin and that of insulin.  448 449  C peptide has no known conclusive effects on carbohydrate metabolism,  450 451  although certain physiologic effects of C peptide have been proposed.  452  Unlike insulin, C peptide is not extracted by the liver  443 453 454  and is excreted almost exclusively by the kidneys. Its plasma half-life of approximately 30 minutes  455 contrasts sharply with that of insulin, which is approximately 4 minutes. \n \nBecause C peptide is secreted in equimolar concentrations with insulin and is not extracted by the liver, levels of C peptide can be used as a marker of beta-cell function. The use of plasma C-peptide levels as an index of beta-cell function depends on the critical assumption that the mean clearance rate of C peptide is constant over the range of C-peptide levels observed under normal physiologic conditions. This assumption has been shown to be valid for both dogs and humans,  441 456  and this approach can be used to derive rates of insulin secretion from plasma concentrations of C peptide under steady-state conditions.  456  However, because of the long plasma half-life of C peptide, under non–steady-state conditions (e.g., after stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose), peripheral plasma levels of C peptide do not change in proportion to the changing insulin secretion rate.  456 457 Therefore, under such conditions, insulin secretion rates are best calculated with use of the two-compartment model initially proposed by Eaton and coworkers.  458 \n \nModifications to the C peptide model of insulin secretion have been introduced. They combine the minimal model of insulin action with the two-compartment model of C-peptide kinetics and allow insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity to be derived after intravenous or oral administration of glucose.  459 460 461 462 \n \nSignaling Pathways in the Beta Cell and Insulin Secretion \n \nThe signaling pathways in the pancreatic beta cell are involved in the stimulus-secretion coupling of insulin release. These pathways provide the mechanism whereby insulin secretion rates respond to changes in blood glucose concentrations ( Fig. 31-13 ). Glucose enters the pancreatic beta cell by a process of facilitated diffusion mediated by the glucose transporter GLUT2. Although levels of GLUT2 on the beta-cell membrane are reduced in diabetic states for various reasons, it is not currently believed that this is a rate-limiting step in the regulation of insulin secretion.  \n \nThe first rate-limiting step in this process is the phosphorylation of glucose to glucose 6-phosphate. This reaction is mediated by the enzyme glucokinase.  463 464  There is considerable evidence that glucokinase, by determining the rate of glycolysis, functions as the glucose sensor of the beta cell and that this is the primary mechanism by which the rate of insulin secretion adapts to changes in blood glucose. According to this view, as blood glucose levels increase, more glucose enters the beta cell, the rate of glycolysis increases, and the rate of insulin secretion increases. A fall in blood glucose levels results in a fall in the rate of glycolysis and a reduction in the rate of insulin secretion. \n \nGlucose metabolism produces an increase in cytosolic ATP, the key signal that initiates insulin secretion by causing blockade of the K ATP channel on the beta-cell membrane. Blockade of this channel induces membrane depolarization, which leads to an increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ and insulin secretion. The biochemical events that link the increase in glycolysis to an increase in ATP are complex. Dukes and coworkers  465  proposed that glycolytic production of NADH during the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate is the key process because NADH is subsequently processed into ATP by mitochondria through the operation of specific shuttle systems. \n \nThe rate of pyruvate generation has also been proposed as an explanation for the link between glucose metabolism and increased insulin secretion.  466  According to this view, pyruvate generated by the glycolytic pathway enters the mitochondria and is metabolized further in the TCA cycle. Electron transfer from the TCA cycle to the respiratory chain by NADH and the reduced form of flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH 2 ) promotes the generation of ATP, which is exported into the cytosol. The increase in ATP closes ATP-sensitive K + channels, which depolarizes the beta-cell membrane and opens the voltage-dependent Ca 2+ channels, leading to an increase in intracellular Ca 2+ . The increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ is the main trigger for exocytosis, the process by which insulin-containing secretory granules fuse with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of insulin into the circulation. The increase in ATP not only closes K ATP channels but also serves as a major permissive factor for movement of insulin granules and for priming of exocytosis. \n \nCyclic AMP also plays an important role in beta-cell signal transduction pathways. This second messenger is generated at the plasma membrane from ATP and potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, particularly in response to glucagon, GLP-1, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP; also known as glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide). The cAMP-dependent pathways appear to be particularly important in the exocytotic machinery. \n \nK ATP channels play an essential role in beta-cell stimulus-secretion coupling; an excellent review was published by Aguilar-Bryan and colleagues.  467  K ATP channels include sulfonylurea receptors (SURs) and potassium inward rectifiers (Kir6.1 and Kir6.2), which assemble to form a large octameric channel with a (SUR/Kir6.x) stoichiometry. In the pancreatic beta cell, the SUR1/Kir6.2 pairs constitute the K ATP channel. K ATP channels control the flux of potassium ions driven by an electrochemical potential. Opening of these channels can set the resting membrane potential of beta cells below the threshold for activation of voltage-gated Ca 2+ channels when plasma glucose levels are low, thus reducing insulin secretion. Changes in the cytosolic concentrations of ATP and ADP lead to closure of the channels and depolarization of the beta-cell membrane. Mutations in both components of the beta-cell K ATP (i.e., SUR1 and Kir6.2) have been shown to lead to hypersecretion of insulin, resulting clinically in either a recessive form of familial hyperinsulinemia or persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy. \n \nPhysiologic Factors Regulating Insulin Secretion \n \nCarbohydrate Nutrients \n \nThe most important physiologic substance involved in the regulation of insulin release is glucose.  468 469 470  The effect of glucose on the beta cell is dose related. Dose-dependent increases in concentrations of insulin and C peptide and in rates of insulin secretion have been observed after oral and intravenous glucose loads, with 1.4 units of insulin, on average, being secreted in response to an oral glucose load as small as 12 g.  471 472 473 474  The insulin secretory response is greater after oral than after intravenous glucose administration.  475 476 477  Known as the incretin effect ,  473 478  this enhanced response to oral glucose has been interpreted as an indication that absorption of glucose by way of the gastrointestinal tract stimulates the release of hormones and other mechanisms that ultimately enhance the sensitivity of the beta cell to glucose (see later discussion). In a study involving normal volunteers, glucose was infused at a rate designed to achieve levels previously attained after an oral glucose load. The amount of insulin secreted in response to the intravenous load was 26% less than that secreted in response to the oral load.  477 \n \nInsulin secretion does not respond as a linear function of glucose concentration. The relationship of glucose concentration to the rate of insulin release follows a sigmoidal curve. The threshold corresponds to the glucose levels normally seen under fasting conditions, and the steep portion of the dose-response curve corresponds to the range of glucose levels normally achieved postprandially.  479 480 481  The sigmoidal nature of the dose-response curve has been attributed to a gaussian distribution of thresholds for stimulation among the individual beta cells.  481 482 483 \n \nWhen glucose is infused intravenously at a constant rate, an initial biphasic secretory response is observed that consists of a rapid, early insulin peak followed by a second, more slowly rising peak.  468 474 475  The significance of the first-phase insulin release is unclear, but it might reflect the existence of a compartment of readily releasable insulin within the beta cell or a transient rise and fall of a metabolic signal for insulin secretion.  484  Despite early suggestions to the contrary,  485 486  it has been demonstrated that the first-phase response to intravenous glucose is highly reproducible within subjects.  487  After the acute response, a second phase of insulin release occurs that is directly related to the level of glucose elevation. In vitro studies of isolated islet cells and perfused pancreas have identified a third phase of insulin secretion that commences 1.5 to 3.0 hours after exposure to glucose and is characterized by a spontaneous decline in secretion to 15% to 25% of the amount released during peak secretion. This low level is subsequently maintained for longer than 48 hours.  488 489 490 491 \n \nIn addition to its acute secretagogue effects on insulin secretion, glucose has intermediate- and longer term effects that are physiologically and clinically relevant. In the intermediate term, exposure of the pancreatic beta cell to a high concentration of glucose primes its response to a subsequent glucose stimulus, leading to a shift to the left in the dose-response curve relating glucose and insulin secretion.  492 493  However, when pancreatic islets are exposed to high concentrations for prolonged periods, a reduction of insulin secretion is seen. Although all of the precise mechanisms responsible for these adverse effects, termed glucotoxicity , are not known, there is evidence that long-term exposure to high glucose reduces the expression of a number of genes that are critical to normal beta-cell function, including the insulin gene.  494 495 \n \nNoncarbohydrate Nutrients \n \nAmino acids have been shown to stimulate insulin release in the absence of glucose, the most potent secretagogues being the essential amino acids leucine, arginine, and lysine.  496 497  The effects of arginine and lysine on the beta cell appear to be more potent than those of leucine. The effects of amino acids on insulin secretion are potentiated by glucose.  498 499 \n \nIn contrast to amino acids, various lipids and their metabolites appear to have only minor effects on insulin release in vivo. Although carbohydrate-rich fat meals stimulate insulin secretion, carbohydrate-free fat meals have minimal effects on beta-cell function.  500  Ketone bodies and short- and long-chain fatty acids have been shown to stimulate insulin secretion acutely in islet cells and in human subjects.  501 502 503 504 505  The effects of elevated FFAs on the insulin secretory responses to glucose are related to the duration of the exposure. Zhou and Grill  506  first suggested that long-term exposure of pancreatic islets to FFAs inhibited glucose-induced insulin secretion and biosynthesis. This observation was confirmed in rats.  507  In humans, it was demonstrated that the insulin resistance induced by an acute (90-minute) elevation in FFAs was compensated by an appropriate increase in insulin secretion.  508  After chronic elevation of FFAs (48 hours), the beta-cell compensatory response for insulin resistance was not adequate. Additional studies demonstrated that the adverse effects of prolonged FFAs on glucose-induced insulin secretion are not seen in subjects with T2DM. From these results, it appears that elevated FFAs might contribute to the failure of beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance. \n \nHormonal Factors \n \nThe release of insulin from the beta cell after a meal is facilitated by a number of gastrointestinal peptide hormones, including GIP, cholecystokinin, and GLP-1.  478 509 510 511 512 513 514 515 516  These hormones are released from small intestinal endocrine cells postprandially and travel in the bloodstream to reach the beta cells, where they act through second messengers to increase the sensitivity of these islet cells to glucose. In general, these hormones are not themselves secretagogues, and their effects are evident only in the presence of hyperglycemia.  509 510 511  The release of these peptides might explain why the modest postprandial glucose levels achieved in normal subjects in vivo have such a dramatic effect on insulin production, whereas similar glucose concentrations in vitro elicit a much smaller response.  516  Similarly, this incretin effect could account for the greater beta-cell response observed after oral as opposed to intravenous glucose administration. \n \nWhether impaired postprandial secretion of incretin hormones plays a role in the inadequate insulin secretory response to oral glucose and to meals in patients with IGT or diabetes is controversial,  517 518 519 520 521 522 523 524 but pharmacologic doses of these peptides might have future therapeutic benefit. Subcutaneous administration of GLP-1, the most potent of the incretin peptides, lowers glucose in patients with T2DM by stimulating endogenous insulin secretion and perhaps by inhibiting glucagon secretion and gastric empyting.  525 526  However, because of the short half-life of GLP-1, its longer-acting analogue, exendin-4, has greater therapeutic promise.  527 Treatment with supraphysiologic doses of GIP during hyperglycemia has been shown to augment insulin secretion in normal humans  528 529  but not in diabetics.  520 529  Although cholecystokinin has the ability to augment insulin secretion in humans, it is not firmly established whether it is an incretin at physiologic levels. 530 531 532 533  Its effects are also seen largely at pharmacologic doses.  534 \n \nThe postprandial insulin secretory response may also be influenced by other intestinal peptide hormones, including vasoactive intestinal polypeptide,  535  secretin,  536 537 538 539  and gastrin,  536 540  but the precise roles of these hormones remain to be elucidated. \n \nThe hormones produced by pancreatic alpha and beta cells also modulate insulin release. Whereas glucagon has a stimulatory effect on the beta cell,  541  somatostatin suppresses insulin release.  542  It is currently unclear whether these hormones reach the beta cell by traveling through the islet cell interstitium (thus exerting a paracrine effect) or through islet cell capillaries. Indeed, the importance of these two hormones in regulating basal and postprandial insulin levels under normal physiologic circumstances is in doubt. Paradoxically, the low insulin levels observed during prolonged periods of starvation have been attributed to the elevated glucagon concentrations seen in this setting.  500 543 544 545 546  Other hormones that exert a stimulatory effect on insulin secretion include growth hormone,  547  glucocorticoids,  548  prolactin,  549 550 551  placental lactogen,  552  and the sex steroids.  553 \n \nWhereas all of the preceding hormones might stimulate insulin secretion indirectly by inducing a state of insulin resistance, some might also act directly on the beta cell, possibly to augment its sensitivity to glucose. Hyperinsulinemia is associated with conditions in which these hormones are present in excess, such as acromegaly, Cushing syndrome, and the second half of pregnancy. Furthermore, treatments with placental lactogen,  554  hydrocortisone,  555  and growth hormone  555 556  are all effective in reversing the reduction in insulin response to glucose that is observed in vitro after hypophysectomy. Although hyperinsulinemia after an oral glucose load has been observed in patients with hyperthyroidism,  557 558  the increased concentration of immunoreactive insulin in this setting may reflect elevations in serum proinsulin rather than a true increase in serum insulin.  559 \n \nNeural Factors \n \nThe islets are innervated by the cholinergic and adrenergic limbs of the autonomic nervous system. Although both sympathetic stimulation and parasympathetic stimulation enhance secretion of glucagon,  560 561  the secretion of insulin is stimulated by vagal nerve fibers and inhibited by sympathetic nerve fibers.  560 561 562 563 564 565  Adrenergic inhibition of the beta cell appears to be mediated by the α-adrenoceptor, because its effect is attenuated by the α-antagonist phentolamine  561  and reproduced by the α 2 -agonist clonidine.  566  There is also considerable evidence that many indirect effects of sympathetic nerve stimulation play a role in regulating beta-cell function through stimulation or inhibition of somatostatin, β 2 -adrenoceptors, and the neuropeptides galanin and neuropeptide Y.  567 \n \nParasympathetic stimulation of islets results in stimulation of insulin, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide directly and through the neuropeptides vasoactive in­testinal polypeptide, gastrin-releasing polypeptide, and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide.  567  In addition, sensory innervation of islets may play a role in tonic inhibition of insulin secretion through the neuropeptides calcitonin gene-related peptide  568 569 570  and, less clearly, substance P.  571 572 \n \nThe importance of the autonomic nervous system in regulating insulin secretion in vivo is unclear. The neural effects on beta-cell function cannot be entirely dissociated from the hormonal effects because some of the neurotransmitters of the autonomic nervous system are, in fact, hormones. Furthermore, the secretion of insulinotropic hormones such as GIP and GLP-1 postprandially has been shown to be under vagal  573 574  and adrenergic  575 576  control. \n \nTemporal Pattern of Insulin Secretion \n \nIt has been estimated that 50% of the total insulin secreted by the pancreas in any 24-hour period is secreted under basal conditions, and the remainder is secreted in response to meals.  577 578  The estimated basal insulin secretion rates range from 18 to 32 units (0.7 to 1.3 mg) per 24 hours.  456 458 471 577  After meal ingestion, the insulin secretory response is rapid, and insulin secretion increases approximately fivefold over baseline to reach a peak within 60 minutes ( Fig. 31-14 ; see Fig. 31-13 ). When study subjects consumed 20% of calories with breakfast and 40% with lunch and dinner, the amount of insulin secreted after each meal did not differ significantly. There was a rapid insulin secretory response to breakfast, with 71.6% ± 1.6% of the insulin secreted in the 4 hours after the meal being produced in the first 2 hours and the remainder in the next 2 hours. Insulin secretion did not decrease as rapidly after lunch and dinner, with, respectively, 62.8% ± 1.6% and 59.6% ± 1.4% of the total meal response secreted during the first 2 hours after the meal. \n \nThe normal insulin secretory profile is characterized by a series of insulin secretory pulses. After breakfast, 1.8 ± 0.2 secretory pulses were identified in normal volunteers, and the peaks of these pulses occurred 42.8 ± 3.4 minutes after the meal. Multiple insulin secretory pulses were also identified after lunch and dinner. After these meals, up to four pulses of insulin secretion were identified in both groups of subjects. In the 5-hour time interval between lunch and dinner, an average of 2.5 ± 0.3 secretory pulses were identified, and 2.6 ± 0.2 were identified in the same period after dinner.  578 \n \nPulses of insulin secretion that did not appear to be meal related were also identified. Between 11 pm and 6 am and in the 3 hours before breakfast, on average 3.9 ± 0.3 secretory pulses were present in normal subjects. Therefore, over the 24-hour period of observation, a total of 11.1 ± 0.5 pulses were identified in normal subjects. Almost 90% (87% ± 3%) of postmeal pulses in insulin secretion, but only 47% ± 8% of non–meal-related pulses, were concomitant with a pulse in glucose.  578 \n \nIn vivo studies of beta-cell secretory function have demonstrated that insulin is released in a pulsatile manner. This behavior is characterized by rapid oscillations occurring every 8 to 15 minutes that are superimposed on slower (ultradian) oscillations occurring at a periodicity of 80 to 150 minutes.  579  The rapid oscillations persist in vitro and therefore are likely to be the result of metabolic pathways in the pancreatic beta cell that involve negative feedback loops with time lags. \n \nRapid Oscillations \n \nThe rapid oscillations of insulin are of small amplitude in the systemic circulation, averaging between 0.4 and 3.2 µU/mL in several published human studies.  580 581 582  Because these values are close to the limits of sensitivity of most standard insulin radioimmunoassays, the characterization of these oscillations is subject to considerable pitfalls,  583  not the least of which is the need to differentiate between true oscillations of small amplitude and random assay noise. The latter problem has been overcome by the development of extremely sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that allow the detection of extremely small changes in peripheral insulin concentrations. The application of these assays in studies involving frequent sampling from the peripheral circulation has led to a series of studies of the role of these oscillations in the overall regulation of insulin secretion.  584 585 586 587 588 \n \nThese investigations suggested that the increases in overall insulin secretion seen in response to a variety of secretagogues in various physiologic and pathophysiologic states result from an increase in the amplitude of the bursts of insulin secretion. The researchers have proposed that 75% of insulin secretion is accounted for by secretory bursts and that the responses to GLP-1, sulfonylureas, and oral glucose are all mediated by an increase in the amplitude of insulin secretory pulses. Furthermore, consistent with observations made by O'Rahilly and colleagues,  589  relatives of patients with T2DM demonstrate a disorderly profile of the insulin secretory oscillations. A number of mathematical programs have been developed that allow these insulin secretory oscillations to be evaluated and studied.  590  The latest additions to the list are so-called approximate entropy (ApEn) and cross-approximate entropy (cross-ApEn) , which are statistics that measure temporal regularity of the oscillations in the insulin secretory profile.  591 \n \nThe low amplitude of the rapid oscillations in the systemic circulation contrasts sharply with observations in the portal vein, where pulse amplitudes of 20 to 40 µU/mL have been recorded in dogs.  592  Although the physiologic importance of these low-amplitude rapid pulses in the periphery is unclear, they are likely to be of physiologic importance in the portal vein. It is possible that the liver responds more readily to insulin delivered in a pulsatile fashion than to insulin delivered at a constant rate.  593 594 595 \n \nUltradian Oscillations \n \nIn contrast to the rapid oscillations, the slower (ultradian) oscillations are of much larger amplitude in the peripheral circulation. They are present under basal conditions but are amplified postprandially ( Fig. 31-15 ), and they have been observed in subjects receiving intravenous glucose, suggesting that they are not generated by intermittent absorption of nutrients from the gut. Furthermore, they do not appear to be related to fluctuations in glucagon or cortisol levels,  488  and they are not regulated by neural factors, because these oscillations are also present in recipients of successful pancreas transplants.  596 597  Many of these ultradian insulin and C-peptide pulses are synchronous with pulses of similar oscillatory periods in glucose, raising the possibility that these oscillations are a product of the insulin-glucose feedback mechanism. Ultradian oscillations are self-sustained during constant glucose infusion at various rates; they are increased in amplitude after stimulation of insulin secretion without change in frequency, and there is a slight temporal advance of the glucose versus the insulin oscillation.  \n \nThese findings suggest that the ultradian oscillations may be entirely accounted for by the major dynamic characteristics of the insulin-glucose feedback system, with no need to postulate the existence of an intrapancreatic pacemaker.  598  In support of this hypothesis, Sturis and colleagues  599  demonstrated that when glucose is administered in an oscillatory pattern, ultradian oscillations in plasma glucose and insulin secretion are generated that are 100% concordant with the oscillatory period of the exogenous glucose infusion. This close relationship between the ultradian oscillations in insulin secretion and similar oscillations in plasma glucose was further exemplified in a series of dose-response studies in which the largest-amplitude oscillations in insulin secretion were observed in those subjects exhibiting the largest amplitude glucose oscillations, which in turn were directly related to the infusion dose of glucose. It has been shown that, in normal humans, insulin is more effective in reducing plasma glucose levels when it is administered intravenously as a 120-minute oscillation than when it is delivered at a constant rate. These results indicate that the ultradian oscillations have functional significance.  599 \n \nCircadian Oscillations \n \nCircadian variations in the secretion of insulin have also been reported. When insulin secretory responses were measured for a 24-hour period during which subjects received three standard meals, the maximal postprandial responses were observed after breakfast.  578 580  These findings were mirrored by the results of studies in which subjects were tested for oral glucose tolerance at different times of the day and were found to exhibit maximal insulin secretory responses in the morning and lower responses in the afternoon and evening.  600 601  These diurnal differences were also noted in tests for intravenous glucose tolerance. Furthermore, although ultradian glucose and insulin oscillations are closely correlated during a constant 24-hour glucose infusion, the nocturnal rise in mean glucose levels is not accompanied by a similar increase in the insulin secretory rate.  602  It has been postulated that these diurnal differences reflect diminished responsiveness of the beta cell to glucose in the afternoon and evening.  601 \n \nInsulin Secretion in Obesity and Insulin Resistance \n \nObesity and other insulin-resistant states are associated with a substantially greater risk of developing T2DM. The ability of the pancreatic beta cell to compensate for insulin resistance determines whether blood glucose levels remain normal in insulin-resistant subjects or whether the subjects develop IGT or diabetes. \n \nThe nature of the beta cell's compensation for insulin resistance involves hypersecretion of insulin even in the presence of normal glucose concentrations. This can occur only if beta-cell sensitivity to glucose is increased. The increase in beta-cell sensitivity to glucose in obesity appears to be mediated by two factors. First, increased beta-cell mass is observed in obesity and other insulin-resistant states.  603  Second, insulin resistance appears to be associated with increased expression of hexokinase in the beta cell relative to the expression of glucokinase.  604 Because hexokinase has a significantly lower Michaelis constant (K m ) for glucose than glucokinase does, the functional effect of increased hexokinase expression is to shift the glucose–insulin secretion dose-response curve to the left, leading to increased insulin secretion across a wide range of glucose concentrations. \n \nAssessment of the adequacy of the beta-cell compensation for insulin resistance is important because this is the major determinant of the development of diabetes. In insulin-resistant states, it is important to evaluate beta-cell function in relation to the degree of insulin resistance. Kahn and coworkers  605  studied the relationship between insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in 93 relatively young, apparently healthy human subjects with varying degrees of obesity. A sensitivity index (SI) was calculated using the minimal model of Bergman as a measure of insulin sensitivity and was then compared with various measures of insulin secretion.  461 606  The relationship between the SI and the beta-cell measures was curvilinear and reciprocal for fasting insulin concentration ( p < 0.0001), first-phase (acute) insulin response (AIR glucose; p < 0.0001), glucose potentiation slope ( n = 56; p < 0.005), and beta-cell secretory capacity (AIR max ; n = 43; p < 0.0001). The curvilinear relationship between SI and the beta-cell measures could not be distinguished from a hyperbola (i.e., SI × beta-cell function = a constant). The nature of this relationship is consistent with a regulated feedback loop control system such that, for any difference in SI, a proportionate reciprocal difference occurs in insulin levels and responses in subjects with similar carbohydrate tolerance. Therefore, in human subjects with normal glucose tolerance and varying degrees of obesity, beta-cell function varies quantitatively with differences in insulin sensitivity. The increase in insulin secretion that is observed with a fall in SI should be viewed as the beta-cell compensation that allows normal glucose tolerance to be maintained in the presence of insulin resistance. \n \nThe insulin resistance of obesity is characterized by hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia in this setting reflects a combination of increased insulin production and decreased insulin clearance, but most evidence suggests that increased insulin secretion is the predominant factor.  607 608  Both basal and 24-hour insulin secretory rates are three to four times higher in obese subjects and are strongly correlated with BMI. Insulin secretory responses to intravenous glucose have been studied in otherwise healthy insulin-resistant subjects and compared with the responses in insulin-sensitive subjects by means of a graded glucose infusion. \n \nFigure 31-16 depicts insulin concentrations and insulin secretion rates at each level of plasma glucose achieved, outlining the respective dose-response relationships. Both insulin concentrations and insulin secretion rates are increased in insulin-resistant subjects as a result of a combination of increased insulin secretion and decreased insulin clearance. For each level of glucose, insulin secretion rates are higher in insulin-resistant than in insulin-sensitive subjects, reflecting an adaptive response of the beta cell to peripheral insulin resistance. Similar compensatory hyperinsulinemia has been demonstrated using other clinical techniques, such as the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test, in obese patients and in those with other insulin-resistant states, such as late pregnancy.  \n \nInsulin Secretion in Subjects With Impaired Glucose Tolerance \n \nIt has been suggested that insulin secretion may be normal in subjects with IGT. However, substantial defects in insulin secretion have been demonstrated in people who have normal FPG and normal HbA 1c concentrations, with glucose values greater than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) 2 hours after oral ingestion of 75 g of glucose. Therefore, defects in insulin secretion can be detected before the onset of overt hyperglycemia. \n \nDetailed study of insulin secretion in patients with IGT has demonstrated consistent quantitative and qualitative defects in this group. During OGTT, there is a delay in the peak insulin response.  143 610 611  The glucose–insulin secretion dose-response relationship is flattened and shifted to the right ( Fig. 31-17 ), and first-phase insulin responses to an intravenous glucose bolus are consistently decreased in relation to ambient insulin sensitivity. \n \nThe temporal pattern of insulin secretory responses is altered in IGT and is similar to but not as pronounced as that seen in diabetic subjects (see later discussion). There is a loss of coordinated insulin secretory responses during oscillatory glucose infusion, indicating that the ability of the beta cell to sense and respond appropriately to parallel changes in the plasma glucose level is impaired ( Fig. 31-18 ). Abnormalities in rapid oscillations of insulin secretion have also been observed in first-degree relatives of patients with T2DM who have only mild IGT, 589  further suggesting that abnormalities in the temporal pattern of beta-cell function may be an early manifestation of beta-cell dysfunction preceding the development of T2DM.  \n \nBecause an elevation in serum proinsulin is seen in subjects with diabetes, the contribution of proinsulin to the hyperinsulinemia of IGT has been questioned. The hyperinsulinemia of IGT has not been accounted for by an increase in proinsulin, although elevations in fasting and stimulated proinsulin levels or proinsulin-to-insulin ratios have been found by many (although not all) investigators.  614 615 616 617 618 619  Correlation of elevated proinsulin levels in IGT as a predictor of future conversion to diabetes has also been observed.  620 621 622 \n \nInsulin Secretion in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nBecause of the presence of concomitant insulin resistance, patients with T2DM are often hyperinsulinemic, but the degree of hyperinsulinemia is inappropriately low for the prevailing glucose concentrations. Nevertheless, many of these patients have sufficient beta-cell reserve to maintain a euglycemic state by diet restriction with or without an oral agent. The beta-cell defect in patients with T2DM is characterized by an absent first-phase insulin and C-peptide response to an intravenous glucose load and a reduced second-phase response.  623  Although hyperglycemia can play a role in mediating these changes, the abnormal first-phase response to intravenous glucose persists in patients whose diabetic control has been greatly improved,  624 625  consistent with the idea that patients with T2DM have an intrinsic defect in the beta cell. \n \nFurthermore, abnormalities in first-phase insulin secretion were observed in first-degree relatives of patients with T2DM who exhibited only mild IGT,  626  and an attenuated insulin response to oral glucose was observed in normoglycemic twins of patients with T2DM,  627  a group at high risk for T2DM and who can legitimately be classified as prediabetic.  628  This pattern of insulin secretion during the prediabetic phase was also seen in subjects with IGT who later developed T2DM  501 629 630  and in normoglycemic obese subjects with a recent history of gestational diabetes,  631  another group at high risk for T2DM.  632  Beta-cell abnormalities can therefore precede the development of overt T2DM by many years. \n \nT2DM also affects proinsulin levels in serum. Increased levels of proinsulin are consistently seen in association with increases in the proinsulin-to-insulin molar ratio.  623  The amount of proinsulin produced in this setting appears to be related to the degree of glycemic control rather than the duration of the diabetic state, and in one series proinsulin levels contributed almost 50% of the total insulin immunoreactivity in T2DM patients who had marked hyperglycemia. In addition to intact proinsulin, the beta cell secretes one or more of the four major proinsulin conversion products (split 32,33-proinsulin, split 65,66-proin-sulin, des-31,32-proinsulin, and des-64,65-proinsulin) into the circulation. These conversion products are produced within the secretory granules of the islet as a result of the activity of specific conversion enzymes at the two cleavage sites in proinsulin that link the C peptide to the A and B chains.  614 615 616 617 618 619 620 621 \n \nThe composition of the elevated proinsulin-like immunodeficiency in patients with T2DM compared with control subjects has not been fully characterized. Hales and colleagues  633  developed immunoradiometric assays for this purpose. In studies using these assays, split 32,33-proinsulin was reported to be the predominant proinsulin conversion product in the circulation, although des-31,32-proinsulin levels can also be elevated. Insulin, proinsulin, and conversion product concentrations were also measured with these assays 30 minutes after oral glucose administration in patients with T2DM. Insulin was reduced in all patients, with no overlap between patients and control subjects, and concentrations of proinsulin and conversion products were elevated in the diabetic patients. These data highlight the importance of the potentially confounding effects of proinsulin and proinsulin conversion products in the interpretation of circulating immunoreactive insulin in patients with T2DM and emphasize the need to measure the concentrations of the individual peptides. \n \nAbnormalities in the temporal pattern of insulin secretion have also been demonstrated in patients with T2DM. In contrast to normal subjects, in whom equal amounts of insulin are secreted basally and postprandially in a given 24-hour period, patients with T2DM secrete a greater proportion of their daily insulin under basal conditions ( Fig. 31-19 ).  634  This reduction in the proportion of insulin secreted postprandially appears to be related in part to a reduction in the amplitude of the secretory pulses of insulin occurring after meals, rather than to a reduction in the number of pulses. In contrast to normal subjects, patients with T2DM have ultradian oscillations in insulin secretion that are less tightly coupled with oscillations in plasma glucose ( Fig. 31-20 ). Similar findings were observed in patients with IGT studied under the same experimental conditions and in a further group of T2DM patients studied under fasting conditions. The rapid insulin pulses are also abnormal in patients with T2DM. The persistent regular rapid oscillations present in normal subjects are not observed. Instead, the cycles are shorter and irregular. Similar findings were observed in a group of first-degree relatives of patients with T2DM who had only mild IGT, suggesting that abnormalities in oscillatory activity may be an early manifestation of beta-cell dysfunction. \n \nThe effects of therapy on beta-cell function in patients with T2DM have also been investigated. Although interpretation of the results in many instances is limited because beta-cell function was not always studied at comparable levels of glucose before and during therapy, the majority of the studies indicated that improvements in diabetic control are associated with an enhancement of beta-cell secretory activity. This increased endogenous production of insulin appears to be independent of the mode of treatment and is in particular associated with increases in the amount of insulin secreted postprandially.  625 635  The enhanced beta-cell secretory activity after meals reflects an increase in the amplitude of existing secretory pulses rather than an increased number of pulses. Despite improvements in glycemic control, beta-cell function is not normalized after therapy, suggesting that the intrinsic defect in the beta cell persists. \n \nTreatment with the sulfonylurea glyburide increases the amount of insulin secreted in response to meals but does not correct the underlying abnormalities in the pattern of insulin secretion. In particular, the abnormalities in the pulsatile pattern of ultradian insulin secretory oscillations persist on treatment with glyburide despite the increased secretion of insulin.  636 \n \nThe effects on insulin secretion of improving insulin resistance in subjects with IGT through the use of the insulin-sensitizing agent troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione, have also been investigated. Troglitazone therapy improved insulin sensitivity, and this was associated with enhanced ability of the pancreatic beta cell to respond to a glucose stimulus, as judged by improvements in the dose-response relationships between glucose and insulin secretion as well as enhanced ability of the pancreatic beta cell to detect and respond to small oscillations in the plasma glucose concentration.  637 \n \nEffects of Genetic Variants on Insulin Secretion \n \nA number of the loci that have been associated with increased risk for T2DM appear to affect insulin secretion. Gene-phenotype studies have involved large numbers of subjects, and as a consequence, they have generally relied on simple measures of beta-cell function (e.g., the early insulin response to oral glucose). This approach has been very successful in identifying variants that primarily reduce insulin levels. More detailed phenotyping studies are now being undertaken in smaller groups of subjects to answer specific questions including the following: \n \n1. Are the risk variants associated with altered clinical and physiologic findings before diabetes onset? \n2. Is insulin secretion reduced equally in response to both oral and intravenous glucose? \n3. Is the incretin effect reduced? \n4. Are the dose-response relationships between glucose and insulin secretion altered? \n5. Is there a concomitant change in insulin action? \nStudies demonstrate that KCNJ11 and TCF7L2 are involved in the regulation of insulin secretion, but their clinical manifestations in humans are different, consistent with different mechanisms for their effects on the beta cell. Nondiabetic subjects with the KCNJ11 T2DM-associated Lys-variant of E23K showed a significant reduction (approximately 40%) in insulin secretion after both oral and intravenous glucose, compared with subjects who did not carry this variant.  638  Hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps demonstrated that hepatic insulin sensitivity is increased in subjects with the Lys-variant, and as a result, normal glucose tolerance is maintained despite reduced insulin secretion. Therefore, the E23K variant appears to affect both insulin secretion and insulin action. The mechanisms responsible for the increase in insulin sensitivity are unclear. One possibility is that they represent a compensatory response to reduced insulin secretion. An increase in insulin sensitivity has also been observed in normoglycemic carriers of HNF1A mutations who have reduced insulin secretion.  639 \n \nIn contrast, carriers of risk variants in TCF7L2 have a different phenotype, with normal insulin secretory responses to intravenous glucose including normal dose-response relationships between glucose and insulin secretion, reduced responses to oral glucose with a reduced incretin effect, and no change in insulin sensitivity. Concentrations of the two major incretins GLP-1 and GIP are normal after oral glucose administration, implicating resistance of the pancreatic beta cell to the stimulatory effects of one or both of these incretins. These results are consistent with those of Schafer and associates,  640  who also documented reduced responses to GLP-1. \n \nRodent Models \n \nA number of spontaneous and genetically selected animal models of T2DM have been identified. Most of the models combine the two main features of T2DM: obesity-associated insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction with or without diminished beta-cell mass. As with diabetes in humans, the different rodent models of T2DM have similarities, but a number of overt and subtle differences make them useful surrogates for intensive study of the syndromes associated with T2DM. \n \nAn interesting observation is the striking sexual dimorphism in most rodent models of T2DM, with the male being affected exclusively, earlier, or more severely in most instances. This is not like the human situation. The advent of transgenic and knockout technology in mice has produced a wide range of models of insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction that result in hyperglycemia. It is beyond the scope of this chapter to review each of these, and the reader is referred to the primary literature for review of these animals. The discussion here is limited to the well-documented spontaneous or derived models of the disease in rodents. \n \nMouse Models of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nLeptin ( Lep ob ) and Leptin Receptor (db) Mutations \n \nThe ob mutation, now designated Lep ob , was first described in 1950,  641  but the gene mutation responsible for the syndrome was not described until the ob mutation was found to be located in the gene for leptin.  642  Mice homozygous for the ob mutation do not produce the satiety factor leptin and become markedly hyperphagic, obese, insulin resistant, and hyperinsulinemic. They have a multitude of other hypothalamic dysfunctions that render them hypometabolic, contribute to the obesity, and result in infertility.  643 644  Leptin treatment of these mice results in decreased food intake and reverses many of their other metabolic defects.  645 646 647 648 649  The ob mice develop obesity at weaning that becomes progressive because of hyperphagia. Insulin resistance is seen in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver, with a variety of signaling defects that are reversible with insulin administration.  650  The ob mouse becomes hyperglycemic and has a profound hyperinsulinemia associated with beta-cell hyperplasia, with up to a 10-fold increase in islet mass.  651 652 \n \nParabiotic experiments between ob and db mice suggested that the db mutation would be found in the receptor for ob . This was confirmed with the identification of multiple mutations in the leptin receptor in db mice.  653 654 Like ob mice, db mice are hyperphagic and begin to surpass their littermates in weight at weaning. They are progressively hyperinsulinemic, become hyperglycemic at 6 to 8 weeks and, because of a decline in beta-cell function,  655 656 657 658  become markedly hyperglycemic at 4 to 6 months. The reason for the more severe diabetes in db mice is not clear, but it may be related to background strain differences, because similar defects in insulin signaling are seen in this animal model as well.  659  Treatment of both ob and db mice with insulin-sensitizing agents such as thiazolidinediones reversed the insulin resistance and ameliorated or prevented the onset of diabetes.  660 661 \n \nAgouti Mouse \n \nIn mice, dominant yellow mutations in the agouti gene produce obesity and hyperglycemia. Depending on the background strain, the agouti mutation has a variable phenotype. In susceptible strains, the onset of hyperinsulinemia begins at 6 weeks of age, and insulin levels continue to increase with age, along with beta-cell hyperplasia and hypertrophy.  662 663  The agouti mutation results in systemic production of a protein normally expressed in the skin, most frequently because of a retrotransposon insertion into the promoter region of the gene.  664  A number of genes, including the fatty acid synthase gene, have both insulin and agouti response elements; this results in a marked increase in expression and leads to increased hepatic fatty acid synthesis and enhanced fat deposition in adipocytes.  654 665 666  The hyperglycemia is postprandial, and the FPG levels are usually normal. The exact function of the agouti gene is unknown, but the animals are hyperphagic and show enhanced growth. \n \nKK Mouse \n \nKK mice were originally bred for enhanced size, but they are not as obese as most other obese mice (usually <60 g). Breeding of the KK mouse into various background strains has produced variable insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperglycemia. The most studied strain is the KKA y , produced in Japan.  667  This mouse has markedly increased insulin levels (>1000 µU/mL) when fed a high-fat diet.  668 669  As the male mouse ages, glucose levels fall toward the normal range. The mutation responsible for the KK phenotype is unknown. \n \nNew Zealand Obese Mouse \n \nNew Zealand obese (NZO) mice were derived by inbreeding of abdominally obese outbred mice.  652 670 671 672 NZO neonates have high birth weights, and mice of both sexes are large and at weaning exhibit an elevated carcass fat content.  670  Approximately 40% to 50% of group-caged NZO males, but not females, develop T2DM between 12 and 20 weeks of age when maintained with a chow diet containing 4.5% fat.  673  Obesity in NZO mice is characterized by widespread accumulation of subcutaneous and visceral fat. The obesity in these mice is accompanied by IGT in males, associated with increased hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance. In contrast to those in ob and db mice, genes encoding certain gluconeogenic and glycolytic enzymes in the liver of NZO mice retain normal responsiveness to insulin, although there is evidence for an inappropriately active fructose-1,6-biphosphatase.  674 675 676  Defective beta-cell insulin secretion from NZO islets in vitro and in vivo has been described.  670  There appears be a defect in the glycolytic pathway in beta cells that leads to defective glucose-stimulated insulin release.  677 \n \nThe genetics of NZO mice show a polygenic disorder, and none of the allelic variants have been discovered. Complicating the analysis of the model is the susceptibility of the mice to autoimmune disorders, including a lupus-like syndrome  678 679  and insulin receptor autoantibodies.  680  There is also a maternal influence in the peripartum period in the development of the disorder, which may reflect substances in the maternal milk.  681 \n \nGold Thioglucose–Induced Diabetes \n \nGold thioglucose induces specific lesions in the ventromedial hypothalamus and induces an initial chronic hyperinsulinemia that leads to hypoglycemia, hyperphagia, obesity, and the development of insulin resistance and hypergly­cemia.  682  This model has been used as an example of pancreatic dysfunction preceding the induction of insulin resistance as opposed to pancreatic compensation for insulin resistance. \n \nDiabetes Induced by Fat Ablation \n \nThree models of insulin-resistant diabetes have been created in which adipose tissue is genetically eliminated by overproduction of foreign genes using the fat-specific promoter aP2 (adipocyte protein 2). Expression of an attenuated diphtheria toxin in adipose tissue resulted in an age-dependent loss of fat, progressive insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and significant diabetes.  683 684  Adipose-specific expression of a constitutively active form of the SREBP1c also resulted in fat ablation.  685  Lipoatrophy was induced by fat-specific overexpression of a dominant-negative form of the transcription factor A-ZIP/F.  686 687  The A-ZIP/F protein heterodimerizes with and inactivates basic zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, including AP1 and CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (CEBP) isoforms, probably disrupting normal fat development. \n \nThe lack of fat in the various models leads to hepatomegaly, insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia, hypoleptinemia, and significant IGT and diabetes. These mice represent a model of human lipodystrophic diabetes and demonstrate the importance of fat in normal glucose homeostasis. It has been suggested that the lack of fat depots results in elevated fatty acid delivery to liver and muscle and the development of insulin resistance. The diabetes in these animals can be variously treated by thiazolidinediones,  683  leptin administration,  688  and fat transplantation.  687  Human lipodystrophy also responds to thiazolidinedione treatment,  689  suggesting that some of the effects of these compounds are not wholly dependent on adipose tissue. \n \nC57BL/6J Mouse Fed a High-Fat Diet. \n \nMale C57BL/6J (also known as B6) mice that were fed a high-fat, high-carbohydrate diet (a so-called Western diet, 58% fat by kilocalories) developed hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperlipidemia, and increased adiposity.  690 691  Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was blunted, and there was significant insulin resistance. 692 693  Despite obesity, plasma leptin levels in the Western diet–fed B6 mice were significantly lower than in control mice in the absence of hyperphagia.  690 694  The weight gain is related primarily to an increase in mesenteric adiposity, which makes this a good model for human adult-onset T2DM. \n \nRat Models of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nZucker Diabetic Fatty Rat \n \nThe ortholog of the db mouse, the obese Zucker rat (fa/fa) , has a mutation in the leptin receptor that results in significant hyperphagia.  695  The fa mutation is different from the mutations in db in that it does not disrupt leptin receptor gene expression and does not affect ligand binding.  695 696  This mutation results in a constitutive intracellular signaling domain, which may induce a desensitization of the leptin signaling pathways.  697 \n \nThe selection of the inbred Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat strain used Zucker (fa/fa) rats that had progressed to a diabetic phenotype. Brother-sister matings resulted in a strain exhibiting development of diabetes in almost 100% of the male rats consuming a 5% fat diet.  698  Hyperglycemia begins to develop in males at 7 weeks of age, with serum glucose levels rising to 500 mg/dL by 12 weeks of age. The hyperinsulinemia precedes hyperglycemia with marked islet hyperplasia and dysmorphogenesis,  699  but by 19 weeks insulin levels drop concomitantly with islet atrophy, in part because of an imbalance of hyperplasia and apoptosis.  603  The islets of prediabetic ZDF rats secrete significantly more insulin in response to glucose, with elevated basal levels of insulin secretion and a leftward shift but a blunted glucose dose-response curve.  604 700  Islets of prediabetic male ZDF rats also have defects in the normal oscillatory pattern of insulin secretion.  701 \n \nIn contrast to the male ZDF rat, the female rat has significant insulin resistance but does not become diabetic unless given a proprietary high-fat diet (GMI 13004, developed by Genetic Models, Inc., Indianapolis, IN).  702 The high-fat diet appears to have a direct effect on the beta cell, because there is no change in peripheral insulin sensitivity (P. Hansen and C.F. Burant, unpublished observations). There is a decrease in peripheral triglyceride and FFA levels in the female rat after institution of the high-fat diet. \n \nThe underlying genetic defect that results in beta-cell failure in the ZDF rat is unknown. The beta-cell number and insulin content are not different from those in homozygous normal animals, but insulin promoter activity is doubled in the ZDF rat.  703  Insulin promoter mapping studies suggest that a critical region in the promoter of the insulin gene is affected. A number of other gene expression differences have been described in ZDF islets, including decreases in the expression of GLUT2  704 705  ; increases in glucokinase and hexokinase activity  700  ; decreases in mitochondrial metabolism  700  ; accumulation of intraislet lipid and long-chain fatty acyl-CoA, which is associated with abnormal beta-cell secretion  701 706 707  ; and increased accumulation of nitric oxide and ceramide,  708 709  which is associated with apoptosis. Other gene expression changes are also found in the prediabetic rat islet.  710  Which of these defects is important for the development of the diabetes is not clear. \n \nThe fixed genetic defect in the male animal leads to diabetes, but this defect also interacts with the insulin resistance, because treatment with insulin-sensitizing agents can prevent the onset of diabetes in male and female rats.  707 711  These agents are not effective in the male after establishment of diabetes; however, the female rat can respond to thiazolidinediones even after significant hyperglycemia. \n \nGoto-Kakizaki Rat \n \nThe Goto-Kakizaki (GK) inbred rat strain was derived from outbred Wistar rats by selection for IGT.  712  Early in the development of diabetes, glucose and insulin are mildly elevated, but as the animals age, reduced beta-cell mass becomes evident, with markedly diminished insulin stores and abnormal secretory responses to glucose. 713 714  A number of biochemical defects have been described in the islets of these animals, including decreased energy production,  715 716 717  expression of proteins involved in insulin granule movement,  718  and decreased adenylate cyclase activity.  719  Defects in peripheral signaling include decreased maximal and submaximal insulin-stimulated IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS1-associated PI3K activity, Akt activation in muscle,  720 defective regulation of protein phosphatase-1 and -2A, and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation by upstream insulin-signaling components in adipocytes.  721  Some of these defects may be a result of hyperglycemia, because they can be reversed by phlorizin-induced normalization of serum glucose.  720 \n \nBHE/Cdb Rat \n \nThe Bureau of Home Economics (BHE/Cdb) rat is a subline of the parent BHE strain that was obtained by selection for hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia without obesity.  722  Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is markedly diminished in these rats, a trait that is maternally inherited.  723  A significant defect appears to be present in the liver. Increased gluconeogenesis and lipogenesis precede the hyperglycemia, which may be caused by defects in mitochondrial respiration associated with mitochondrial DNA mutations.  724 725 \n \nPsammomys obesus (Sand Rat) \n \nThe sand rat (Psammomys obesus) is a nutritionally induced obesity model of T2DM. Genetically, the animal is in reality a gerbil, and it usually lives on a low-calorie vegetable diet.  726  When given a high-carbohydrate diet, the sand rat rapidly becomes hyperglycemic secondary to weight gain associated with significant insulin resistance  727  and enhanced hepatic glucose production.  728  When a relatively hypocaloric diet is restored, the metabolic syndrome reverts to normoglycemia. A subpopulation of the sand rat develops frank beta-cell failure and becomes ketotic. \n \nOtsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty Rat \n \nThe Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima fatty (OLETF) rat strain was derived from the Long-Evans rat with polyuria, polydipsia, and mild obesity.  729  About 90% of the male animals become diabetic by 1 year of age. Statistical tests have determined that the locus containing the cholecystokinin A receptor is responsible for about 50% of the T2DM in the OLETF rats.  730  The receptor is disrupted in the OLETF rat because of a 165-bp deletion in exon 1. 731 732  Genetic segregation analysis has shown interaction with a second locus, Obd2 , which acts in a synergistic fashion to result in NIDDM, and both of these loci are required in homozygous OLETF rats to cause elevated plasma glucose.  733 \n \nThe role of sex hormones is pronounced in this strain. Orchiectomy markedly reduces the incidence of diabetes in the male, and oophorectomy increases the rate of hyperglycemia to 30% in the female. Treatment of castrated males with testosterone restores the incidence of diabetes to 89%. The islets undergo a progressive inflammatory reaction with progressive fibrosis. This reaction is associated with the impairment of beta-cell function.  734 Obesity and insulin resistance appear to precede the development of beta-cell failure.  735  Studies have also shown that obesity is necessary for the development of T2DM in OLETF males and that insulin resistance may be closely related to fat deposition in the abdominal cavity.  736  Troglitazone and metformin have been used successfully to treat diabetes in the OLETF rat, and troglitazone completely prevents the morphologic and functional deterioration of the beta cells.  737 \n \nNeonatal Streptozotocin \n \nTwo models have been described in which a single dose of the beta-cell toxin, streptozotocin, is given to 2-day-old female Wistar  738 739  or male Sprague-Dawley rats.  740 741  These animals have a transient hyperglycemia but develop IGT at 4 to 6 weeks of age. There is an initial reduction of beta-cell mass, but subsequent regeneration results in restoration of the beta-cell mass to a level approximately 50% lower than the normal adult level. \n \nManagement \n \nOver the past 15 years, a conceptual transformation in the principles of management of T2DM has occurred. Fundamentally, there has been a change in the level of concern about diabetes as a public health issue and in attitudes about its treatment. Dramatic advances in the spectrum of pharmacologic agents and monitoring technology available for the treatment of diabetes have made it possible to lower glucose levels safely to the near-normal range in most patients. Great strides have been made in establishing an evidence base for guidelines regarding glycemic control and efforts to reduce the risk of complications. Corporate and government health insurance providers have greatly improved the extent to which diabetes equipment and supplies are covered. \n \nA comprehensive review of all the subtleties of diabetes management in the 21st century is beyond the scope of this chapter. Here, we deal with the salient features of the epidemiology of the complications of T2DM, diagnostic strategies, treatment guidelines, lifestyle interventions, and pharmacotherapy before turning briefly to a discussion of preventive measures for T2DM and its complications. An excellent source of information on these issues is the Clinical Practice Recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), which is published as the first supplement to the journal Diabetes Care each January and is available online.  742 \n \nScope of the Problem \n \nAs discussed previously, in the United States in 2014, nearly 30 million people had diabetes with over 25% undiagnosed. Since 2007, the prevalence has risen from 7.8% to 9.3%. The increasing burden of diabetes is driven by population aging; by population growth, particularly among ethnic groups with greater susceptibility to the disease; and by increases in rates of obesity as a consequence of increasingly sedentary lifestyles and greater consumption of simple sugars and calorie-dense foods. Furthermore, at least in the United States, opportunistic screening for diabetes in high-risk populations is recommended by professional societies and many insurers, and this has resulted in an increase in the proportion of people affected being diagnosed, from approximately 50% in the 1990s to over 70% today. The morbidity, mortality, and expense associated with diabetes are staggering.  3 4 5 In Western society, people with diabetes are three times more likely to be hospitalized than nondiabetic persons. In the United States, diabetes is the leading cause of blindness and accounts for more than 40% of new cases of end-stage renal disease. The risk of heart disease and stroke is two to four times higher, and the risk of lower-extremity amputation is approximately 20 times higher for people with diabetes than for those without diabetes. Life expectancy is reduced by approximately 10 years in people with diabetes, and although diabetes is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, this figure is clearly an underestimate. Only about 35% to 40% of those who die with diabetes have the disease listed anywhere on the death certificate, and only 10% to 15% have it listed as the underlying cause of death. \n \nRates of complications in diabetes declined between 1990 and 2010 on the order of 50% or greater for MI, stroke, amputations, and death from hyperglycemic crisis; end-stage renal disease was reduced approximately 30%.  743 Our understanding of the natural history of diabetes is based on outcomes in patients diagnosed decades ago. Societal change, earlier diagnosis of diabetes, enhanced treatment of diabetes and its comorbid conditions, and intervention earlier in the course of complications results in substantial uncertainty about the future that patients diagnosed today will face. We believe that patients treated according to guidelines have an excellent prognosis in 2015. The major issues determining health outcomes today are socioeconomic and are related to access to care and health disparities.  744 \n \nGlucose Treatment Guidelines \n \nStudy Results and Recommendations \n \nProspective, randomized clinical trials have documented improved rates of microvascular complications in patients with T2DM treated to lower glycemic targets. In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS),  745 746  patients with new-onset diabetes were treated with diet and exercise for 3 months, with an average reduction in HbA 1c from approximately 9% to 7% (upper limit of normal is 6%). Those patients with FPG greater than 108 mg/dL (6 mmol/L) were then randomly assigned to two treatment policies. In the standard intervention, subjects continued the lifestyle intervention. Pharmacologic therapy was initiated only if the FPG reached 15 mmol/L (270 mg/dL) or the patient became symptomatic. In the more intensive treatment program, all patients were randomly assigned and treated with either sulfonylurea, metformin, or insulin as initial therapy, with the dose increased to try to achieve an FPG of less than 108 mg/dL. Combinations of agents were used only if the patient became symptomatic or FPG rose to greater than 270 mg/dL (15 mmol/L). \n \nAs a consequence of the design, although the HbA 1c fell initially to about 6%, over the average 10 years of follow-up it rose to approximately 8%. The average HbA 1c in the standard treatment group was approximately 1 percentage point higher. The risk of severe hypoglycemia was small (on the order of 1% to 5% per year in the insulin-treated group) and weight gain was modest; both were higher in patients randomly assigned to insulin and lower in those receiving metformin.  746  Associated with this improvement in glycemic control, there was a reduction in the risk of microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) in the group receiving intensive treatment. Although there was a trend toward reduced rates of macrovascular events in the more intensively treated group, it did not reach statistical significance.  745 \n \nSimilar reductions in microvascular events were observed in another trial of entirely different design and much smaller size. In the Kumamoto study, Japanese patients of normal weight with T2DM receiving insulin were randomly assigned to standard treatment or an intensive program of insulin therapy designed to achieve normal glycemia. The control group maintained HbA 1c values at approximately 9%, whereas the HbA 1c in the intensive therapy group was reduced to approximately 7%, and the separation was maintained for 6 years. Again, there was a modest increased risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain, a reduction in microvascular complications, and a nonstatistically significant trend toward reduced rates of vascular end points.  747 \n \nIn 2008, three studies examining the effects of two levels of glycemic control on cardiovascular end points in T2DM were reported. Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD),  748  Action in Diabetes and Vascular Disease—Preterax and Diamicron Modified Release Controlled Evaluation (ADVANCE),  749  and the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT)  750  each randomized middle-aged and older individuals who were at high risk for cardiovascular events. ACCORD and VADT aimed for an HbA 1c target of less than 6% using complex combinations of oral agents and insulin. ADVANCE aimed for an HbA 1c target of 6.5% or less using a somewhat less intensive approach based on the addition of the sulfonylurea gliclazide. None of the trials demonstrated a statistically significant benefit on combined vascular end points. ACCORD demonstrated a 22% increase in total mortality rate, whereas VADT had numerically more deaths in the intensively treated group (hazard ratio, 1.07). Modest improvements in some microvascular end points in all three trials were demonstrated. In these studies, there were suggestions that people who were without clinical cardiovascular disease and had shorter duration of disease and lower baseline HbA 1c demonstrated greater benefits from the more intensive glucose-lowering strategies. \n \nFurthermore, a 10-year follow-up of the UKPDS cohort demonstrated that the relative benefit of more intensive management of glucose demonstrated at the end of the randomized portion of the trial was maintained, resulting in the emergence of statistically significant benefits on cardiovascular end points and total mortality rate.  751 Meta-analysis of cardiovascular outcomes in randomized trials suggested that an average HbA 1c reduction of 0.9% correlates with a 17% reduction in nonfatal MI and a 15% reduction in coronary heart disease without significant effects on stroke or all-cause mortality rate; however, as mentioned previously, there is significant heterogeneity in the result with respect to mortality rate across trials, the cause of which is completely uncertain. 752 \n \nFinally, two post hoc analyses in ACCORD have added further insights into the risk of fatality with intensive management. First, in an analysis of on-treatment HbA 1c , in the intensive treatment group, which did experience an overall increase in mortality rate, the increase was isolated to those who had on treatment average HbA 1c greater than 7%. Thus, aiming for an HbA 1c of less than 6% and achieving a target of less than 7% was not associated with excess mortality rate.  753  In the second analysis, the hemoglobin glycation index (HGI = observed HbA 1c − predicted HbA 1c ) was calculated using baseline HbA 1c and fasting glucose. ACCORD participants in the top tertile of HGI (i.e., a higher HbA 1c than would be predicted based on fasting glucose) had increased mortality rate and no benefit on the primary end point (the first occurrence of heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death). On the other hand, those in the lower and middle tertile of HGI had no increased mortality rate and an approximate 25% benefit on the primary end point. In ACCORD, HGI calculated at baseline identified subpopulations in ACCORD with harms or benefits from intensive glycemic control suggesting that HbA 1c is not a one-size-fits-all indicator of blood glucose control, and failure to take this into account could result in suboptimal diabetes care.  754 \n \nBlood Glucose Treatment Targets \n \nGuidelines from the ADA and the American College of Endocrinology (ACE) are presented in Table 31-6 . The ADA suggests that the goal of treatment in the management of diabetes should be an HbA 1c value of less than 7% in general. Furthermore, the ADA suggests that lower targets may be pursued in selected patients, such as those with recent-onset disease, long life expectancy, and no significant cardiovascular disease, if they can be achieved without significant hypoglycemia or other adverse effects of treatment. Conversely, they recommend that less stringent HbA 1c goals may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced complications, and extensive comorbid conditions as well as in those who do not achieve HbA 1c less than 7% despite diabetes self-management education and effective doses of insulin in combination therapy.  7  ACE has recommended an HbA 1c goal that is less than or equal to 6.5%, again with language suggesting individualization of targets. \n \nWith respect to fasting, premeal, or postprandial targets, there is little support for any particular level of glycemic control in the management of T2DM because no large-scale outcome study has targeted particular levels of glucose with home glucose monitoring. The ADA target for fasting (and premeal) plasma glucose levels, 80 to 130 mg/dL, was developed based on an estimate of the range of average glucose values that would be associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia and an HbA 1c of less than 7%.  7  The ACE fasting glucose target of less than 110 mg/dL is an effort to achieve normal levels of glycemia.  755  However, consistent fasting and premeal glucose levels lower than 110 mg/dL would be expected to be associated with an HbA 1c of approximately 5.5%.  756 \n \nThe ADA treatment target for peak postprandial glucose levels is set at less than 180 mg/dL, in part because such levels would be associated with an HbA 1c of approximately 7% and because nondiabetic persons who consume a large evening meal have been demonstrated to exhibit transient elevations of glucose to that level.  757  There are no published studies documenting safety or outcomes for a particular targeted level of postprandial blood glucose. However, there are effective HbA 1c -lowering agents that primarily target postprandial glucose levels, and monitoring of postprandial glucose levels may be necessary to optimize dose adjustment of these agents. Furthermore, some patients with diabetes have average FPG levels within their target range but an elevated HbA 1c . In these patients, monitoring and specific treatment of postprandial elevations can provide improvements in HbA 1c , perhaps with a lower risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain than has been associated with further lowering of fasting and premeal glucose levels.  758  The ACE has recommended a targeted 2-hour postprandial glucose concentration of less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) in an effort to achieve near-normal glycemia.  755 Consistent postprandial glucose values lower than 140 mg/dL would be associated with an average HbA 1c of approximately 5%.  756 \n \nLifestyle Intervention \n \nThe components of lifestyle intervention include medical nutrition counseling, exercise recommendations, and comprehensive diabetes education with the purpose of changing the paradigm of care in diabetes from provider focused to patient focused. Arguably, since the turn of the 21st century, nothing has changed more fundamentally than the emphasis on lifestyle intervention. For decades, physicians and patients have paid lip service to the notion that lifestyle intervention is important. Now we have significant clinical trial evidence that each component of lifestyle intervention, when appropriately administered, can contribute to improved outcomes. Furthermore, since passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and complementary legislation in most state governments, lifestyle intervention has been a covered benefit for most insured people. Although full implementation of these regulations is still in progress, they have dramatically expanded the fraction of the population with diabetes who can acquire insurance coverage for these essential services. \n \nPatient Education \n \nDiabetes is a lifelong disease, and health care providers have almost no control over the extent to which patients adhere to the day-to-day treatment regimen. The appropriate role of the health care provider is to serve as a coach to the patient, who has primary responsibility for the delivery of daily care. As a result, health care providers must carefully engage patients as partners in the therapeutic process. It is critical for the health care professional to understand the context in which patients are taking care of their disease. A prescriptive approach, in which patients are told what to do, can work in some situations but fails more often than not because of unrecognized barriers to the execution of a particular plan. For long-term success, diabetes self-management education is critical. \n \nDiabetes self-management education is the process of providing to the person with diabetes knowledge and skills needed to perform self-care, manage crises, and make lifestyle changes.  759  As a result of this process, the patient must become a knowledgeable and active participant in the management of his or her disease. To achieve this task, patients and providers work together in a long-term, ongoing process. Minimal diabetes education should be universally provided and individualized with emphasis on the core issues highlighted in Table 31-7 . There are many more specialized topics relevant to almost all patients, such as how to adjust therapy when eating out or during travel, review of available local health care resources such as support groups, and insurance issues. Although there are only limited studies, they do provide support for the concept that diabetes education can be cost-effective and can improve outcomes.  \n \nCurricular Areas That Should Be Addressed in Diabetes Self-Management Education \n \n• Describing the diabetes disease process and treatment options \n• Incorporating nutritional management into lifestyle \n• Incorporating physical activity into lifestyle \n• Using medication(s) safely and for maximum therapeutic effectiveness \n• Monitoring blood glucose and other parameters and interpreting and using the results for self-management decision making \n• Preventing, detecting, and treating acute complications \n• Preventing, detecting, and treating chronic complications \n• Developing personal strategies to address psychosocial issues and concerns \n• Developing personal strategies to promote health and behavior change \n \nA team of providers is usually required to fully implement the process of diabetes self-management education, because the amount of information that needs to be exchanged is large and the needed range of expertise is broad. It is usually not possible to cover the recommended content fully in the context of several or even many brief encounters with a physician in an office setting. Potential providers in a team care approach include nurses, dietitians, exercise specialists, behavioral therapists, pharmacists, and other medical specialists including diabetologists or endocrinologists, podiatrists, medical subspecialists, obstetrician-gynecologists, psychiatrists, and surgeons. The potential role of the community in which the patient lives and works in the diabetes self-care process is enormous; family, friends, employers, and health insurance providers may all be involved. Each potential member of the team has a role to play in the process, which must be reviewed and assessed frequently ( Table 31-8 ). The primary roles of the providers in this process are to supply guidance in goal setting to manage the risk of complications, suggest strategies for achieving goals and techniques to overcome barriers, provide training in skills, and help screen for complications. For this process to be a success, the patient must commit to the principles of self-care, participate fully in the development of a treatment plan, make ongoing decisions regarding self-care from day to day, and communicate honestly and with sufficient frequency with the team.  \n \nTeam Care: Roles of the Players \nPrimary Care Provider \n• To be a source of accurate information and to refer to and coordinate with other sources of information as necessary \n• To provide guidance in developing goals of treatment \n• To screen for complications and evaluate progress in meeting treatment goals \n• To help develop strategies for achieving treatment goals and avoiding complications \n \nOther Providers \n• To be a source of accurate information, to communicate with the primary care provider, and to coordinate with other sources of information as necessary \n• To provide guidance in developing goals of treatment and to help the primary care provider develop strategies to achieve treatment goals and avoid complications \nPatient \n• To commit to diabetes self-management (see Table 31-7 ) \n• To be an active participant in the process \n• To communicate with other team members when goals are not achieved or barriers or problems are encountered \nCommunity \n• To provide support to encourage ongoing diabetes self-care \n \nFortunately, barriers to providing team care are becoming less daunting. Diabetes education programs are being rapidly established. The American Association of Diabetes Educators (telephone 800-TEAM-UP4) and the ADA (telephone 800-DIABETEs) can provide information regarding diabetes educators and education programs in the local area. A variety of novel approaches are under study including the use of telehealth capabilities, interactive gaming, and text messaging. \n \nFor team care to be most effective, communication, trust, and mutual respect are critical. However, in many communities, the full benefit of consultation and ongoing care with diabetes educators, nurses, dietitians, pharmacists, and others is not achieved because of overly hierarchic approaches to care. Nonphysicians, including patients, ought to provide suggestions regarding medication and lifestyle adjustments and help in the process of identifying barriers to effective management such as lack of knowledge, lack of time, and lack of resources and strategies to overcome barriers. \n \nPerhaps some of the most overlooked contributors to ineffective care in the setting of T2DM are the relatively common barriers created by psychiatric, neurocognitive function, and adjustment disorders, which are largely responsive to psychosocial therapies.  761 \n \nNutrition \n \nWith respect to self-management education, recent ADA statements document the effect of medical nutrition therapy and offer specific nutritional advice on diabetes-related outcomes (e.g., HbA 1c , weight, proteinuria).  7 These recommendations are summarized in Table 31-9 . A comprehensive, individually negotiated nutrition program in which each patient's circumstances, preferences, and cultural background as well as the overall treatment program are considered is most likely to result in optimal outcomes. Because of the complexity of the medical and nutritional issues for most patients, it is recommended that a registered dietitian with specific skill and experience in implementing nutrition therapy in diabetes management work collaboratively with the patient and other health care team members to provide medical nutrition therapy.  \n \nTABLE 31-9 \nMajor Nutrition Recommendations for Diabetes \nGeneral \n• Individuals who have prediabetes or diabetes should receive individualized medical nutrition therapy (MNT) as needed to achieve treatment goals, preferably provided by a registered dietitian familiar with the components of diabetes MNT. \n• For individuals using fixed daily insulin doses, consistent carbohydrate intake with respect to time and amount can result in improved glycemic control and reduce hypoglycemia risk. \n• A simple diabetes meal planning approach, such as portion control or healthful food choices, may be better suited to individuals with type 2 diabetes with health and numeracy literacy concerns. This strategy also may be effective for older adults. \n• Because MNT can result in cost savings and improved outcomes, MNT should be covered by insurance and other payers. \nEnergy Balance, Overweight, and Obesity \n• For overweight or obese adults with type 2 diabetes or at risk for diabetes, reducing energy intake while maintaining a healthful eating pattern is recommended to promote weight loss. \n• Modest weight loss may provide clinical benefits in some individuals with diabetes, especially those early in the disease process. To achieve modest weight loss, intensive lifestyle interventions with ongoing support are recommended. \nEating Patterns and Macronutrient Distribution \n• Evidence suggests that there is not an ideal percentage of calories from carbohydrate, protein, and fat for all people with diabetes; therefore, macronutrient distribution should be based on individualized assessment of current eating patterns, preferences, and metabolic goals. \n• Carbohydrate amount and available insulin may be the most important factors influencing glycemic response after eating and should be considered when developing the eating plan. \n• Monitoring carbohydrate intake, whether by carbohydrate counting or experience-based estimation, remains critical in achieving glycemic control. \n• Carbohydrate intake from vegetables, fruits, whole grains, legumes, and dairy products should be advised over intake from other carbohydrate sources, especially those that contain added fats, sugars, or sodium. \n• Substituting low glycemic-load foods for higher glycemic-load foods may modestly improve glycemic control. \n• Individuals at high risk for type 2 diabetes should be encouraged to achieve the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommendation for dietary fiber (14 g fiber/1000 kcal) and to consume foods containing whole grains (one half of grain intake). \n• Although substituting sucrose-containing foods for isocaloric amounts of other carbohydrates may have similar blood glucose effects, consumption should be minimized to avoid displacing nutrient-dense food choices. \n• People with diabetes and those at risk should limit or avoid intake of sugar-sweetened beverages to reduce risk for weight gain and worsening of cardiometabolic risk profile. \nProtein \n• In individuals with type 2 diabetes, ingested protein appears to increase insulin response without increasing plasma glucose concentrations. Therefore, carbohydrate sources high in protein should not be used to treat or prevent hypoglycemia. \nDietary Fat Intake in Diabetes Management \n• Evidence is inconclusive regarding an ideal amount of total fat for people with diabetes; therefore, goals should be individualized. Fat quality appears to be far more important than quantity. \n• A Mediterranean-style eating pattern, rich in monounsaturated fatty acids, may benefit glycemic control and cardiovascular disease risk factors and can therefore be recommended as an effective alternative to a lower-fat, higher-carbohydrate eating pattern. \n• Increased consumption of foods containing long-chain omega-3 fatty acids (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid), such as fatty fish, and omega-3 α-linolenic acid (ALA), is recommended. \n• The consumption of fish (particularly fatty fish) at least two times (two servings) per week is recommended. \n• The amount of dietary saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fat recommended for people with diabetes is the same as that recommended for the general population. \n• Evidence does not support recommending omega-3 supplements for people with diabetes for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular events. \nMicronutrients and Herbal Supplements \n• There is no clear evidence of benefit from vitamin or mineral supplementation in people with diabetes who do not have underlying deficiencies. \n• Routine supplementation with antioxidants, such as vitamins E and C and carotene, is not advised due to insufficient evidence of efficacy and concerns related to long-term safety. \n• There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of micronutrients such as chromium, magnesium, and vitamin D to improve glycemic control in people with diabetes. \n• There is insufficient evidence to support the use of cinnamon or other herbs/supplements for the treatment of diabetes. \n• It is recommended that individualized meal planning include optimization of food choices to meet recommended dietary allowance/dietary reference intake for all micronutrients. \nAlcohol \n• If adults with diabetes choose to drink alcohol, they should be advised to do so in moderation (no more than one drink per day for adult women and no more than two drinks per day for adult men). \n• Alcohol consumption may place people with diabetes at an increased risk for delayed hypoglycemia, especially if taking insulin or insulin secretagogues. Education and awareness regarding the recognition and management of delayed hypoglycemia are warranted. \nSodium \n• The recommendation for the general population to reduce sodium to less than 2300 mg/day is also appropriate for people with diabetes. \n• For individuals with both diabetes and hypertension, further reduction in sodium intake should be individualized. \n View full size \nModified from American Diabetes Association. Standards of medical care in diabetes—2015. Diabetes Care. 2015;38:s1-s93. \nStructured programs that emphasize lifestyle changes including education, reduced energy intake (and therefore often fat intake), conscious decisions regarding carbohydrate intake, regular physical activity, and recurring participant contact can produce long-term weight loss of 5% to 7% of starting weight and reduce the risk of developing diabetes. Everyone, especially family members of persons with T2DM, should be encouraged to engage in mindful eating and regular physical activity to decrease the risk of developing T2DM. \n \nPhysicians and other members of the health care team need to understand the major issues in diabetes and nutrition and to support the nutritional plan developed collaboratively. Individualized dietary advice can be developed by a physician from a brief diet history obtained by asking questions such as the following: What do you eat for breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Do you have snacks between breakfast and lunch? Lunch and dinner? Dinner and bedtime? and What do you drink during the day? Ideally, this information should be obtained at each visit, with specific suggestions for changes that both patient and provider agree are important and achievable. \n \nEasy issues to address include caloric beverages, which tend to elevate glucose levels dramatically and can usually be replaced quite painlessly by artificially sweetened alternatives. Juices are generally perceived as healthful but can significantly affect glycemic control and total calorie intake. Substituting low-fat products for higher-fat alternatives is often suggested but needs to be done with the recognition that these products are generally higher in carbohydrates. Fat-free and sugar-free foods need to be recognized as food that is not “free.” Portion control and recipe modification are excellent techniques, particularly for meats and fried foods. \n \nAdequate spacing between meals is usually good advice for patients with T2DM, because postprandial glucose levels typically peak 2 hours after a meal, when a snack would normally be taken. Eating approximately every 4 hours while awake is the most practical dietary plan for most overweight people. Frequent small meals have been shown to be of benefit when used in a controlled inpatient setting, but overweight patients who are encouraged to eat more frequently often overeat more frequently. At a minimum, avoiding high-calorie snacks is reasonable advice for most people with diabetes. A repeated diet history and additional modest changes negotiated every few weeks to months by all health care providers (i.e., doctor, nurse, or dietitian) allow assessment of whether previously agreed to changes were enacted, reinforcement of the importance of diet efforts, and slow enticement of patients into more healthful dietary choices. \n \nIn general, the critical nutrient for glycemic consistency is carbohydrate. Essentially every molecule of carbohydrate consumed is converted to glucose in the gut and requires the action of insulin to be cleared from the circulation. The carbohydrate-counting technique can be used in patients with T2DM to facilitate consistent carbohydrate intake or to allow insulin dose adjustment in response to changes in carbohydrates consumed.  762 Whereas the beta cell in T2DM has usually lost its responsiveness to glucose, the second phase of insulin secretion is largely spared in T2DM and is in part driven by amino acids and fatty acids. Therefore, including some protein and fat in each meal and snack is useful. \n \nDietary fat is the nutrient that is most closely associated in epidemiologic studies with the risk of developing T2DM. Although dietary fats clearly have an impact on total caloric intake (related to their caloric density) and on circulating lipids, they have a minimal impact on glycemia acutely. Fat intake is a contributor to obesity and is the critical nutrient for cardiovascular risk management. It is recommended that people with diabetes (and everyone in general) consume a diet that is modestly restricted in calories (if overweight) and contains less than 10% of total calories as saturated fat and less than 10% as polyunsaturated fat. Some advocate substituting foods high in monounsaturated fatty acids (i.e., seeds, nuts, avocado, olives, olive oil, and canola oil) for carbohydrate, but most patients do not find adequate variety in the monounsaturated fatty acid category and often overeat these high-calorie foods. Higher carbohydrate diets can raise postprandial glucose and triglycerides but are much less calorically dense than higher fat diets and have a higher thermic effect, both of which tend to promote weight loss. \n \nDietary protein similarly has a minimal impact on glucose levels, although amino acids do promote insulin secretion, which may be advantageous in patients with T2DM. Metabolism of protein results in the formation of acids and nitrogenous waste, which can lead to bone demineralization and glomerular hyperfiltration. At least 0.8 g of high-quality dietary protein per kilogram of body weight is generally recommended; restriction of protein intake to 10% to 20% of total calories minimizes potential adverse long-term effects of high protein intake. \n \nThe roles of vitamins, trace minerals, and nutritional supplements in the treatment of diabetes are poorly understood. Some clinicians are convinced of the utility of soluble fiber, magnesium, chromium, zinc, folic acid, pyridoxine, cyanocobalamin, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin E, vanadium, selenium, garlic, and other micronutrients. Clinical trial data to support their safety and efficacy are inconclusive at best. Many patients are convinced that nutritional supplementation is healthful, and it is often counterproductive to engage in scholarly discussion of the nature of the evidence base for their decision. At a minimum, discussion should include the documented efficacy of more classic lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions and the idea that these efforts should not be left by the wayside when budget constraints affect potentially more effective interventions.  763 \n \nAlthough a wide range of dietary recommendations have their proponents, few data support these suggestions from long-term outcome studies of prescribed diets. There are no consistent differences in weight loss or cardiovascular risk factors in up to 2 years of follow-up with low carbohydrate diets versus isoenergetic balanced weight loss diets.  764  That said, if a patient or practitioner wants to use a lower carbohydrate higher protein/fat reduced calorie diet, that is certainly a choice associated with short-term improvements in glycemia, cardiovascular risk markers, and weight. Arguably, the most validated meal plan is the so-called Mediterranean diet which in one large study was able to document reduced cardiovascular end points, fewer new cases of diabetes, and reduced cognitive decline.  765 \n \nWeight loss is a goal of many patients with and without diabetes and certainly is associated with improvements in glycemic control, insulin resistance, circulating lipids, and blood pressure. As reviewed previously, numerous studies document that certain changes can result in modest weight loss that can be largely maintained with sustained effort. These changes include intensive lifestyle programs involving frequent contact with patients, individualized counseling, and education aimed at reducing calorie intake. Additional, complementary changes by the patient include regular physical activity and efforts to understand and control behaviors that result in overeating. \n \nExercise \n \nThere is a substantial body of literature supporting exercise as a modality of treatment in T2DM.  7  Exercise is perhaps the single most important lifestyle intervention in diabetes because it is associated with improved glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, cardiovascular fitness, and remodeling. Aerobic exercise and resistance (strength) training have positive impacts on glucose control. Improvements in glycemic control are usually apparent immediately and become maximal after a few weeks of consistent exercise. However, they may persist for only 3 to 6 days after cessation of training, hence the rationale for negotiating a minimum of three exercise sessions per week to maintain the benefit of the intervention. \n \nThe key concept is to promote an increase in activity using an approach similar to the one discussed for diet. Goals, methods, intensity, and frequency must be negotiated with patients with great sensitivity to recognizing barriers and helping patients discover solutions. The role of educators, exercise specialists, physical therapists, and social supports in this process is critical. The major role for the physician is to screen for complications (neuropathy, nephropathy, retinopathy, vascular disease) and discover ways for patients to be able to exercise safely. Exercise in the presence of uncontrolled diabetes, hypertension, retinopathy, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular disease can create devastating problems. These obstacles can all be addressed creatively and should never present an insurmountable barrier to increasing physical activity. \n \nSome authorities recommend that all patients older than 35 years have a stress test before initiating an exercise program. The utility of stress tests is potentially limited by their poor sensitivity and specificity. If the exercise program contemplated does not involve more strenuous activity (in intensity and duration) than the patient has engaged in recently but merely more frequent activity, screening cardiovascular stress testing is unlikely to be useful. However, when sedentary patients plan to embark on a program of strenuous exercise, stress testing may be prudent to evaluate for subclinical coronary disease. Patients at high risk for coronary artery disease should start with short periods of low-intensity exercise and increase the intensity and duration slowly as tolerated. Patients who develop symptoms of coronary ischemia, including dyspnea out of proportion with activity, should be referred for further evaluation and treatment. Even with negative results on stress testing, it is important to encourage patients not to overexert and to recognize exertional chest, jaw, or arm discomfort as well as palpitations and dyspnea as symptoms of cardiac dysfunction. \n \nOver time, improved exercise tolerance should be viewed as a measure of improved cardiorespiratory function. For aerobic exercise to improve insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, and cardiovascular risk, the patient must engage in at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (50-70% of maximum heart rate) or 75 minutes per week of vigorous aerobic exercise (>70% of maximum heart rate). Exercise should be regular, at least every 48 hours. Patients with T2DM should be encouraged to perform resistance exercise targeting all major muscle groups at least two times a week. For the average patient with T2DM starting an exercise program, this equates to quite low-level activity initially, such as walking at a pace of 2 miles/hour. Initially, it may even be advantageous to negotiate once-weekly walks or shorter duration exercise sessions, or both, and proceed from there. Over time, patients are encouraged to pick up the pace as tolerated and to increase the duration and frequency of exercise sessions slowly to avoid overuse injuries. It is not unreasonable to suggest to patients that if they are going to incorporate exercise into their diabetes management program, they must think of exercise as a treatment that takes the place of a pill and requires adherence to produce benefit. All individuals should be encouraged to reduce sedentary time, particularly by breaking up extended amounts of time (>90 minutes) spent sitting. \n \nSelf-Monitoring of Blood Glucose \n \nSelf-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) has not been demonstrated in clinical trials to change outcomes in T2DM when evaluated in isolation.  7  However, many diabetes self-management programs have been demonstrated to help reduce complications. In all of these, SMBG is an integral part of the process, suggesting that SMBG is at least a component of effective therapy. The frequency and type of monitoring in diabetes therapy should be determined in consultation with the patient, taking into account the nature of the diabetes, the overall treatment plan and goals, and the patient's abilities. SMBG is particularly recommended for all patients with T2DM who are taking insulin or sulfonylureas because it allows patients to identify minimal or asymptomatic episodes of hypoglycemia. \n \nAlthough severe hypoglycemia is relatively rare in T2DM, it can have devastating consequences, such as trauma or self-injury or change in the perceived ability of a patient to continue to live independently as a result of confusion or loss of consciousness. Also, it is essential to have patients critically assess the nature of any hypoglycemic symptoms that may occur. Many patients are fearful or overconcerned about hypoglycemia and routinely consume extra calories in response to a variety of life's circumstances, such as when they are hungry, sweaty, nervous, or upset. Monitoring studies document that most symptoms in patients with T2DM are not related to hypoglycemia and should not be treated with excessive calorie consumption. \n \nTiming of SMBG varies depending on the diabetes therapy. It is important to advise patients to vary the time of the day at which blood glucose levels are checked. For some patients, the highest blood glucose of the day is the morning glucose, whereas for others the highest is before bed. Particularly in early diabetes, gestational diabetes, and well-controlled diabetes, monitoring 1 to 2 hours after meals allows patients to assess the effect of their lifestyle and pharmacologic efforts in controlling postprandial glucose levels, which are usually the only glycemic abnormality present. Monitoring (and thus targeting therapy) at just one time of day can leave the patient with a less than ideal overall response to therapy. \n \nWhen glucose control is poor, having patients concentrate on premeal glucose levels is adequate. Once the premeal glucose levels reach the low 100s, many advocate that patients switch to checking 1- to 2-hour postprandial glucose levels; the latter approach amplifies the observed effect of diet on glycemic control and enables patients to see that moderate changes in meal plan, activity, and medications have a significant impact on glycemic control. Even after substantial inappropriate changes in food intake, activity, or timing or dose of medication, blood sugar values often return to near-normal levels overnight or by the time of the next meal. \n \nThe frequency of glucose monitoring needs to be matched to the individual patient's needs and treatment. Many clinicians ask patients to monitor at least once a day (at varying times before a meal, at bedtime, and at midsleep) as well as with hypoglycemic symptoms. Others ask patients receiving intensive insulin treatment to monitor with an intensity similar to that described for patients with T1DM: four times per day before meals; with weekly checks at least once after breakfast, lunch, dinner, and at midsleep; and with symptoms. Some ask for sets of glycemic readings more infrequently (e.g., fasting and 1 hour after the biggest meal). In the subset of patients who achieve stable blood glucose levels without significant hypoglycemia, it is usually appropriate to decrease the frequency of SMBG to a few times a week. It is critical that SMBG be frequent enough that both patient and provider have a good understanding of the adequacy of the treatment regimen and the stability of glycemic control. \n \nIt has been widely assumed that the benefits of SMBG stem from the effect of putting patients in a situation in which they can be in control of their own therapy. If patients are aware of the glycemic targets associated with the outcomes they seek to achieve, SMBG enables them to critically evaluate their response to therapy and assure themselves that they are reaching their goals. It is useful for patients to keep a daily diary of their SMBG results, so that they can assess their results periodically and can share them with the health care team. Many patients faithfully perform daily or more frequent SMBG, record the results as instructed, and discuss them with their health care team only at quarterly or semiannual visits even though their control is inadequate. Unless SMBG results are generally within agreed target ranges, they should be communicated and reviewed at least monthly with a member of the health care team by telephone, fax, mail, or e-mail or at an interim visit to trigger changes in therapy as the need arises. Unfortunately, such services usually are not reimbursed and can become an unsustainable burden on health care teams. \n \nOne of the most difficult areas in which to keep current is the area of available equipment and supplies, particularly for glucose monitoring. A useful resource in this regard is the annual Consumer Guide , which is published as the January issue of Diabetes Forecast , a magazine for laypeople with diabetes and their families. 766 \n \nPharmacotherapy for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nThe revolution in the treatment of T2DM since 1995 in the United States has been driven by the release of several new classes of drugs that independently address different pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to the development of diabetes. The available oral antihyperglycemic agents can be divided by mechanism of action into several groups: insulin sensitizers with primary action in the liver, insulin sensitizers with primary action in peripheral tissues, insulin secretagogues, agents that slow the absorption of carbohydrates, insulins, agents that increase the activity of the incretin system, agents that increase glucose clearance into the urine, and novel agents whose influence on carbohydrate metabolism is still unclear. Insulin therapy in patients with T2DM effectively is a supplement to endogenous insulin secretion. The relative benefits of lifestyle intervention and the 13 classes of drugs available for the management of T2DM are shown in Table 31-10 . This area has been the subject of extensive reviews.  7 755 756 757 758 759 760 761 762 763 764 765 766 767  In the following discussion, the principles outlined in these reviews are summarized, and limited additional references are provided. \n \nInsulin Sensitizers With Predominant Action in the Liver \n \nMetformin is the only biguanide available in the United States. Phenformin was removed from the U.S. market in the 1970s because of deaths associated with lactic acidosis. Phenformin and buformin remain available in some countries. Although metformin has been available in Europe for over 40 years, it has been approved in the United States only since 1995. The precise mechanism of action of metformin is still controversial.  768  Some studies suggest that it activates AMPK, an intracellular signal of depleted cellular energy stores that has been implicated in stimulation of skeletal muscle glucose uptake and inhibition of hepatic gluconeogenesis, whereas more recent studies implicate inhibiting mitochondrial glycerophosphate dehydrogenase as the primary action. The major clinical activity of metformin is to reduce hepatic gluconeogenesis and glucose production. It has more inconsistently improved insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues. Because of its limited duration of action, it is usually taken at least twice daily, although a sustained-release formulation is available. \n \nBecause biguanides do not increase insulin levels, they are not associated with a significant risk of hypoglycemia. The most common adverse events are gastrointestinal: nausea, diarrhea, crampy abdominal pain, and dysgeusia. About one third of patients have some gastrointestinal distress, particularly early in their course of treatment. This distress can be minimized by starting with a low dose once daily with meals and titrating upward slowly (over weeks) to effective doses. Sustained-release metformin is associated with less frequent and less severe upper gastrointestinal symptoms, the more common of the adverse effects of metformin, but it can increase the frequency of diarrhea, a much less common adverse effect overall. Most patients note no adverse effects with metformin therapy, and at least 90% tolerate it adequately with long-term use. Perhaps as a result of clinical or subclinical gastrointestinal effects, metformin is associated with less weight gain than other antihyperglycemic agents, and in some studies it has been associated with a modest weight loss. \n \nMetformin has been said to cause lactic acidosis, which is quite rare and occurs almost exclusively in patients who are at high risk for development of the condition independent of metformin therapy.  769  The package insert states that metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal insufficiency (male patients with a serum creatinine concentration of 1.5 mg/dL or higher or female patients with 1.4 mg/dL or higher). The drug is cleared renally. Because there is a complex relationship between serum creatinine and renal function, reasonable practice might suggest that metformin can be used safely in patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation down to 30 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 , with dose reduction to a maximum daily dose of 1000 mg when the eGFR falls below about 50 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 and avoidance when the eGFR is less than 30 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 .  770  Metformin is also contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency and in the setting of alcohol abuse. Some patients taking metformin develop progressive vitamin B 12 deficiency; supplementation with relatively high doses of vitamin B 12 (e.g., 1000 µg daily) may be prudent.  771 \n \nThe glucose-lowering efficacy and the prevalence of adverse gastrointestinal effects of metformin increase proportionately in the dose range of 500 to 2000 mg/day. The maximal daily dose of 2550 mg does not generally provide additional benefit beyond that seen at 2000 mg daily. Newer formulations of metformin combined with various classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents have been developed to maximize glucose-lowering effectiveness with a single prescription through the synergy of two classes of agents with different actions. \n \nArguably, metformin has the best record among oral antihyperglycemic agents in outcome studies. In the UKPDS, among overweight subjects, those randomly assigned to metformin not only had improvements in microvascular complications similar to those of subjects randomly assigned to insulin and sulfonylurea but also demonstrated reduced rates of diabetes-related death and MI.  746  However, the validity of this observation has been challenged because of unusual responses in a subsequent subrandomization. The beneficial effect of metformin on macrovascular complications through mechanisms independent of glycemic control is certainly plausible and is supported by such observations as metformin-associated modest reductions in LDL, triglycerides, blood pressure, and procoagulant factors. The general recommendation is to initiate metformin therapy in all patients with T2DM absent contraindications at or near the time of diagnosis of diabetes.  767 \n \nInsulin Sensitizers With Predominant Action in Peripheral Insulin-Sensitive Tissues \n \nThe thiazolidinedione class of drugs (TZDs or glitazones) has engendered great enthusiasm and controversy since the first agent, troglitazone, was approved in 1997. Rare fatal hepatotoxicity was associated with troglitazone, and it was withdrawn from the U.S. market in 2000, largely because the other TZDs (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) were thought to be safer. These agents are believed to work through binding and modulation of the activity of a family of nuclear transcription factors termed peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). They are associated with slow improvement in glycemic control over weeks to months in parallel with an improvement in insulin sensitivity and a reduction in FFA levels. \n \nEach of these agents varies in important ways with regard to potency, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, binding characteristics, and demonstrated lipid effects. At the same time, all are effective glucose-lowering agents that are generally well tolerated. The only significant early adverse effects are weight gain and fluid retention (and associated edema formation and hemodilution). There is no substantial evidence that these newer agents are associated with hepatotoxicity, but a record of safety has been established in appropriate patients. Patients should have liver function tests before beginning TZD therapy. TZDs are contraindicated in patients with active hepatocellular disease and in patients with unexplained serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than 2.5 times the upper limit of normal. \n \nPioglitazone and rosiglitazone are equally effective glucose-lowering agents with similar adverse effect profiles. They also provide equivalent improvements in markers of insulin resistance and inflammation. They differ with respect to lipid effects. In a head-to-head study among dyslipidemic patients, pioglitazone reduced tri­glycerides by approximately 20%, whereas rosiglitazone increased triglycerides on average by 5%. Pioglitazone is associated with a modestly greater improvement in HDL particle number and size and an improvement in LDL particle size and number. Rosiglitazone was associated with an increase in LDL particle number and improved LDL particle size.  772 \n \nThe promise of the thiazolidinedione class to reverse or prevent the negative cardiovascular associations of insulin resistance, in parallel with its demonstrated effect of improving insulin sensitivity, was suggested by a series of associations: reduced carotid intimal medial thickness, normalization of vascular endothelial function, improvements in dyslipidemia, lower blood pressure, and improved fibrinolytic and coagulation parameters. The PROactive (PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events) Study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 5238 patients with T2DM and documented macrovascular disease. Subjects were randomized to placebo or to 45 mg/day of pioglitazone and otherwise treated according to guidelines for hyperglycemia and major cardiovascular risk factors. The primary end point was the time from randomization to a broad set of macrovascular end points. Pioglitazone was associated with a 10% reduction in the primary end point, but the reduction was not statistically significant. However, for the principal secondary end point, time from randomization to any cause of mortality rate, nonfatal MI (excluding silent MI), and stroke, pioglitazone therapy was associated with a 16% reduction, which was marginally statistically significant. Subsequent analysis and discussion of this technically negative and somewhat flawed trial has been extensive and supports the notion that pioglitazone therapy is associated with reductions in cardiovascular events that are largely accounted for by improvements in glycemia, lipids, and blood pressure. The benefits were in part mitigated by an increased incidence of heart failure, weight gain, and edema.  773 \n \nThe RECORD trial (rosiglitazone evaluated for cardiovascular outcomes in oral agent combination therapy for type 2 diabetes) was an open-label study that compared the effect of adding rosiglitazone versus either metformin or sulfonylurea to patients who had T2DM inadequately controlled with sulfonylurea or metformin. There was no difference in cardiovascular hospitalizations or death.  774  There has been a brewing controversy that perhaps rosiglitazone is associated with excess MI, with some calling for its withdrawal from the market.  775  Although there are no definitive data to prove this allegation, it has resulted in dramatic shifts in the marketplace away from rosiglitazone use. \n \nA second attribute of the glitazones that has generated great enthusiasm is an improvement in insulin secretory dynamics in subjects with diabetes and IGT. More importantly, the ADOPT (A Diabetes Outcome Progression Trial) trial in patients with early diabetes demonstrated a lesser rate of secondary glycemic failure in patients treated with rosiglitazone, compared with metformin, and both showed a lesser failure rate than glyburide; these benefits were correlated with indices of beta-cell function.  776  Several trials have demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of thiazolidinediones to delay or prevent the development of diabetes, with greater magnitude than has been reported for other antihyperglycemic agents.  7 767 \n \nThe glitazones have the best track record in regard to slowing the progressive nature of beta-cell deterioration, and this may have important implications for long-term prognosis. On the other hand, multiple adverse effects of the class have raised concerns; these effects include weight gain, fluid retention, and increased risk of bone fractures. Careful study indicates that the weight gain is a result of both fluid retention and subcutaneous (but not visceral) fat accumulation. There is, in fact, a reduction in visceral fat, hepatic fat, and intramyocellular fat. Therefore, it has been argued that the weight gain observed with glitazones may not have the same negative metabolic consequences that are generally ascribed to overweight and obesity. Nevertheless, weight gain is viewed negatively by most patients and practitioners. All patients prescribed glitazones should be counseled to redouble lifestyle efforts to minimize weight gain. \n \nWith regard to edema, with appropriate caution, almost no one should need to withdraw from therapy as a result of fluid retention. The patients most likely to experience edema are those treated with insulin and those with preexisting edema. Therefore, women, overweight patients, and patients with diastolic dysfunction or renal insufficiency are at greatest risk. It is prudent to teach patients with preexisting edema how to assess pitting pretibial edema at home and to suggest that they make a habit of checking nightly. If they note a pattern of increasing edema at home, patients can be instructed to restrict sodium intake, to start a diuretic, or to increase their diuretic dosage by some specified quantity on their own as needed. \n \nIn the previously edematous patient and in patients treated with insulin, it is prudent to initiate therapy with the lowest available dose of thiazolidinedione. In 1 to 3 months, if the glycemic response has been inadequate and significant edema has not developed, consider increasing the dose of thiazolidinedione further, with continued expectant home evaluation for edema. Most patients with mild edema respond to a thiazide diuretic or spironolactone. In patients with more extensive edema, combination therapy with a moderate-dose loop diuretic is sometimes required.  777  Anecdotal reports suggest that avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can reduce the frequency of edema as an adverse event. Fluid retention to the point of congestive heart failure and anasarca has been reported; in the PROactive and RECORD studies, an excess of approximately 2% of patients treated with high-dose glitazones required hospitalization for heart failure. In some patients, edema is refractory to diuretic therapy. Edema resolves with a reduction of thiazolidinedione dose in some patients, but some require drug withdrawal. \n \nA more recent safety concern regarding thiazolidine­diones is bone health. In pharmacoepidemiologic studies and in randomized, controlled trials, excess fractures have been reported, mainly in older women. Whereas distal sites were primarily affected in these studies, small randomized, controlled trials have identified loss of bone density in the lumbar spine as well. Preclinical studies suggest that activation of PPARγ inhibits bone formation by diverting stem cells from the osteogenic to the adipocytic lineage. No data are available with respect to the prevention or management of thiazolidinedione-related bone loss, but prudent measures would include at a minimum an assessment of risk factors and appropriate bone density screening.  778 \n \nFinally, pioglitazone has been implicated as causing bladder cancer as a result of inconsistent preclinical, clinical, and observational studies. In August 2014, a 10-year Kaiser Permanente Northern California study was announced suggesting no increased risk.  779  If pioglitazone is associated with bladder cancer, the absolute risk to an individual is very small. Current recommendations to avoid its use in patients with a history of bladder cancer, however, seem prudent. \n \nInsulin Secretagogues \n \nCurrently available insulin secretagogues all bind to the SUR1, a subunit of the K ATP potassium channel on the plasma membrane of pancreatic beta cells. The SUR1 subunit regulates the activity of the channel and also binds ATP and ADP, effectively functioning as a glucose sensor and trigger for insulin secretion. Sulfonylurea binding leads to closing of the channel, as do increases in intracellular ATP and decreases in ADP resulting from fuel metabolism. The membrane depolarization that ensues causes the opening of voltage-dependent L-type calcium channels. Subsequent calcium influx results in an increase in intracellular calcium, which leads to insulin secretion. Differences in pharmacokinetic and binding properties of the various insulin secretagogues result in the specific responses that each agent produces. The major differences among the insulin secretagogues seem to be related to duration of action and to subtle variations in hypoglycemic potential. \n \nSulfonylureas. \n \nThe sulfonylureas have been available since the 1950s. They have a relatively slow onset and a variable duration of action. The numerous choices available ( Table 31-11 ) can be divided into first- and second-generation agents. In general, the second-generation agents are more potent and, as a result, have fewer adverse effects and drug-drug interactions. Extended-release glipizide and glimepiride are preferred agents because they can be given once daily in most patients and involve a relatively low risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain. Gliclazide is not available in the United States but is a similarly preferred agent in much of the world. Nonetheless, glyburide is one of the most commonly prescribed insulin secretagogues, even in the face of concerns about its potential cardiovascular toxicity and higher risks of hypoglycemia compared with other secretagogues. \n \nAn unusual characteristic of sulfonylureas is that the maximum marketed dose is two to four times higher than the maximum effective dose. There has been concern that sulfonylureas might cause increased arrhythmic cardio­vascular events in patients with diabetes as a result of their activity on vascular and cardiac SUR2 receptors that blunts ischemic preconditioning, a protective autoregulatory mechanism in the heart. On the other hand, of the three recent cardiovascular outcome studies examining the effects of more intensive glycemic control on cardiovascular outcomes, only the ADVANCE trial, which employed the sulfonylurea gliclazide as its dominant strategy, did not exhibit any suggestion of cardiovascular toxicity  749  and the UKPDS similarly demonstrated the long-term safety of glyburide.  745 \n \nSulfonylureas are arguably the most cost-effective glucose-lowering agents. In general, limiting the dose to one fourth of the maximum marketed dose, unless higher doses are clearly demonstrated to provide significant benefits in glycemic control, minimizes costs and adverse events. Small doses of sulfonylurea (e.g., 0.5 to 1 mg of glimepiride or 2.5 mg of extended-release glipizide) are remarkably effective, particularly in patients receiving concomitant insulin-sensitizing therapy, and are almost uniformly well tolerated. The major opposition to early and frequent use of sulfonylureas relates to the generally modest weight gain and hypoglycemia but most specifically to the observation that they are associated with a higher rate of beta-cell failure, which may accelerate the time to requiring additional antihyperglycemic therapy.  776 \n \nGlinides. \n \nRepaglinide is a member of the meglitinide family of insulin secretagogues, distinct from the sulfonylureas. It has a short half-life and a distinct SUR1 binding site. As a result of more rapid absorption, it produces a generally faster and briefer stimulus to insulin secretion. As a result, it is typically taken with each meal and provides better postprandial control and generally less hypoglycemia and weight gain than glyburide. Repaglinide does seem to have a long residence time on the SUR1 and a prolonged effect on FPG, even though its pharmacologic half-life is quite short. Repaglinide is available in 0.5-, 1-, and 2-mg tablets. The maximum dose is 4 mg with each meal. As with the sulfonylureas, there is only a modest glucose-lowering advantage of high doses compared with moderate doses of repaglinide. \n \nNateglinide is a derivative of phenylalanine and is structurally distinct from both sulfonylureas and the meglitinides. It has a quicker onset and a shorter duration of action than repaglinide. Its interaction with SUR1 is fleeting. As a result, its effect in lowering postprandial glucose is quite specific, and it has little effect in lowering FPG. This provides both advantages (less hypoglycemia) and disadvantages (less overall glucose-lowering effectiveness). Nateglinide is most appropriately used when FPG levels are modestly elevated in early diabetes or in combination with insulin sensitizers or long-acting evening insulin. Nateglinide is available as 120-mg tablets and is taken with each meal. A 60-mg tablet is available but is not generally used except in patients with minimal hyperglycemia. \n \nThe rationale for stimulating insulin secretion in a way that minimizes fasting hyperinsulinemia and maximizes postprandial control is compelling. Furthermore, these newer agents demonstrate little binding to the vascular smooth muscle and cardiac SUR2 receptors. However, the use in the United States of these newer glinide agents has been modest, in part because of the need for multiple daily doses, greater expense than with sulfonylureas, and lack of head-to-head comparative studies that demonstrate superiority over newer sulfonylureas, which are already perceived as having low potential for producing hypoglycemia and weight gain. \n \nCarbohydrate Absorption Inhibitors: α-Glucosidase Inhibitors \n \nα-Glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs) work to inhibit the terminal step of carbohydrate digestion at the brush border of the intestinal epithelium. As a result, carbohydrate absorption is shifted more distally in the intestine and is delayed, allowing the sluggish insulin secretory dynamics characteristic of T2DM to catch up with carbohydrate absorption. \n \nThe two currently available agents are acarbose and miglitol. Vogliobose is available in other countries. The use of AGIs in the United States has been limited by a number of factors, including the need to administer the medication at the beginning of each meal, flatulence as a common side effect, and only modest reductions in blood glucose levels. These factors should be balanced against the ability of AGIs to lower postprandial glucose, thereby improving glycemia without increasing weight or hypoglycemic risk. Even though they potentially lower glucose in everyone, the extent of the lowering is modest, calling into question the utility of these agents in light of the substantial expense and side effects. On the other hand, there is evidence that acarbose improves cardiovascular outcomes better than most antihyperglycemic agents.  781 \n \nTo maximize the potential for these agents to be well tolerated, start with a low dose (e.g., one fourth of the maximum dose) just once daily and increase over a period of weeks or months to one quarter to one half of the maximum dose with each meal. \n \nIncretin-Related Therapies \n \nThe incretin effect describes the observation that oral glucose has a greater stimulatory effect on insulin secretion than does intravenous glucose at the same circulating glucose concentration. In humans, this effect seems to be primarily mediated by GLP-1 and GIP. GLP-1 is produced from the proglucagon gene in intestinal L cells and is secreted in response to nutrients. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent fashion, inhibits inappropriate hyperglucagonemia, slows gastric emptying, reduces appetite and improves satiety, and has beta-cell proliferative, antiapoptotic, and differentiation effects at least in vitro and in preclinical models. GLP-1 has a very short half-life in plasma (1 to 2 minutes) due to amino-terminal degradation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). A variety of pharmacologic techniques have been developed to harness the potential of GLP-1 signaling to treat diabetes, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are peptides that produce increases of 10-fold or higher in GLP-1 activity, and DPP4 inhibitors, which are small-molecule inhibitors of the degradation of GLP-1 and GIP as well as other hormones.  782 \n \nGLP-1 Receptor Agonists. \n \nExendin-4 is a naturally occurring component of the saliva of the Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum) and shares 53% sequence identity with GLP-1; it is resistant to DPP4 degradation. Exenatide is synthetic exendin-4 and was the first GLP-1-based therapeutic agent to be approved for human use. When injected subcutaneously, it produces the effects listed earlier and has a peak of action and half-life of approximately 2 hours. With twice-daily injection within 1 hour before a meal, it produces a reduction of approximately 1% in HbA 1c , driven largely by a reduction in postprandial glucose along with modest weight loss (average, 5 to 10 lb/year). With prolonged use, weight loss has been associated with expected improvements in blood pressure and lipids. The most common adverse effect is nausea, which occurs in 40% to 50% of patients, usually early in the course of therapy. The nausea is mild to moderate in intensity and typically wanes over time. Nausea leads to withdrawal of therapy in about 5% of patients. \n \nNewer, longer-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists include liraglutide, once-weekly exenatide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide.  783  In general, these longer-acting agents are associated with greater HbA 1c -lowering efficacy owing to more predominant effects on FPG than exenatide in the twice-daily formulation. They are also associated with fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects, probably because they seem to produce little or no gastric emptying effects. One could argue based on head-to-head studies that liraglutide and dulaglutide are similar in efficacy and minimally more effective than exenatide once weekly, which may be the best tolerated of the longer-acting GLP-1 receptor agonists, at least with respect to nausea. However, exenatide once weekly is associated with skin nodules at the site of injection. Albiglutide seems less effective than the other longer-acting agents. Liraglutide is administered once daily without any restriction as to timing or relation to meals. Once-weekly exenatide requires reconstitution and a somewhat larger bore needle for administration. Once-weekly albiglutide also requires reconstitution but has a smaller bore needle. Once-weekly dulaglutide does not require reconstitution; its pen-like device has a retracting needle and is clearly the least difficult once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist to use. \n \nWeight loss is similar among the various GLP-1 receptor agonists, though perhaps less for albiglutide.  783  Hypo­glycemia is not a direct effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists, but they can amplify the hypoglycemic effects of other agents. Therefore, for coadministration with secretagogues or insulin, it is recommended that the minimum dose of secretagogue be used when initiating GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy, uptitrating the secretagogue later if necessary. A 20% insulin dose reduction is prudent when initiating GLP-1 receptor agonists in insulin-treated patients with T2DM and HbA 1c less than 8%. A concern that emerged from postmarketing reports is pancreatitis. A causal link has not been proved, nor has a mechanism been established. Nevertheless, it is recommended that incretin-based therapy be avoided in those with a history of pancreatitis. Exenatide is renally cleared and is contraindicated in the setting of advanced kidney disease (eGFR <30 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 ). The other GLP-1 receptor agonists do not share this feature with exenatide. Nevertheless, cases of acute renal failure have been reported in association with GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy, usually in patients with chronic renal insufficiency who develop superimposed prerenal azotemia in the context of prolonged nausea, anorexia, and vomiting. To mitigate the risk of pancreatitis and renal failure, it is prudent to instruct patients treated with GLP-1 receptor agonists to hold their medication if they develop nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain of more than a few hours' duration and to seek medical attention if they are unable to keep down fluids after 4 hours. \n \nA new safety concern that arose in preclinical testing with these long-acting agents is medullary thyroid cancer. No signal exists for this problem with GLP-1–based therapy in humans, but there is a clear increase in the incidence of these tumors in rodents, although not in other animal models. GLP-1 plays a role in regulation of C cells in the rodent but apparently not in the human. Nevertheless, it is suggested that these agents be avoided in those with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer. \n \nDPP4 Inhibitors. \n \nFour DPP4 inhibitors—sitagliptin, saxagliptin, linagliptin, and alogliptin—are available in the United States and several others worldwide. These agents produce approximately twofold increases in fasting and postprandial GLP-1 and GIP levels, with subsequent HbA 1c reductions of approximately 0.7%. They are remarkably well tolerated, with an adverse effect profile similar to that of placebo. Specifically, they are not associated with nausea. Probably because of the lesser increase in GLP-1 activity than with the GLP-1 receptor agonists, there is no weight loss with DPP4 inhibitors; they tend to be weight neutral. Postmarketing cases of pancreatitis have been reported for the DPP4 inhibitors, and they are contraindicated for use in those with a prior history. Specificity for DPP4 appears to be crucial, because less specific inhibitors have demonstrated adverse effects on immune function and cancer growth in animal studies. Although the currently marketed DPP4 inhibitors are thought to be highly selective, continued long-term surveillance for unexpected adverse events is essential. Further, the biology of the agents is extremely complex owing to the multiple substrates and peptide fragments whose biology they affect.  784  In cardiovascular outcome trials, there was an increased risk for heart failure hospitalization with saxagliptin and a numerical imbalance for alogliptin; no increased risk was demonstrated for sitagliptin.  785  Whether this represents an important clinical distinction, the play of chance or differences in trial populations or conduct is unclear. \n \nA nice feature of these agents is that they do not require titration. Linagliptin is only available in one tablet size. For the others, which are partially renally cleared, the usual dose is the maximum marketed dose, and smaller doses are recommended in the setting of stage 3 or greater chronic kidney disease. Serious hypersensitivity reactions have been reported, but causality has not been substantiated because of the rarity of events. The weight neutrality, lack of hypoglycemia, broad applicability, tolerability, and ease of use create a unique niche for DPP4 inhibitors and they have been widely adopted in primary care. \n \nSodium-Glucose Transporter-2 Inhibitors. \n \nSGLT2 are the newest class of antihyperglycemic medications, first marketed in 2013 for the treatment of T2DM. 786 787  The kidney plays a central role in the regulation of plasma glucose, filtering at the glomerulus and reabsorbing in the tubules approximately 180 g of glucose per day. Put in perspective, that quantity is equal to the carbohydrate content of a fairly standard diet. In the setting of diabetes, glucose reabsorption is increased as a result of increased expression and activity of SGLT2, a high-capacity low-affinity transporter primarily found in the proximal convoluted tubule of the kidney and responsible for 90% of renal tubular glucose reabsorption. There is a second active transport molecule, SGLT1, which is a low-capacity high-affinity transporter responsible for approximately 10% of glucose reabsorption in the kidney but critically important for glucose absorption from the gut. Naturally occurring mutations in the SGLT2 gene are associated with the rare familial renal glycosuria syndrome associated with 1 to 170 g/day of urine glucose loss, lesser rates of obesity and diabetes, and no evidence of long-term renal consequences. Three SGLT2 inhibitors are currently clinically available, and a number are under development. Canagliflozin is a selective SGLT2 inhibitor with greater than 250-fold selectivity over SGLT1 and a half-life of approximately 12 hours, producing about 70 g of glucose excretion over 24 hours. Dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are arguably more selective and perhaps have a longer half-life, though they all produce similar glucose excretion. They have been studied in T2DM as monotherapy, in combination with other oral antihyperglycemic agents, and with insulin. Head-to-head studies with metformin, sulfonylurea, and DPP4 inhibitors suggest that these agents are equally effective in HbA 1c reduction as the most effective oral agents. Furthermore, they are associated with moderate weight loss—2 to 3 kg over placebo in 26-week studies—as well as blood pressure reduction. The most common side effects are related to glycosuria and include urinary frequency, genital infections, and relatively rare episodes of lower urinary tract infections as well as dehydration and its consequences. Genital infections are generally related to yeast, occur in approximately 10% to 25% of women, and recur with further episodes in a minority of cases. Genital mycotic infections are much less common in men and predominantly are found in those who have not been circumcised. Glomerular filtration is essential for the efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors; empagliflozin is indicated for use down to an eGFR of 45 mL/minute per 1.73 m 2 ; canagliflozin's and dapagliflozin's labels suggest higher eGFR cutoff points for efficacy. Theoretical questions related to bone health as a result of urinary calcium loss have been raised but to date are not evident in clinical trials. An unexplained imbalance in bladder cancer without a change in total cancer or cancer fatality was reported in a dapagliflozin phase II to III clinical program; dapagliflozin is the only agent in the class with a warning to not use the drug in patients with bladder cancer. SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with an increase in plasma glucagon levels through uncertain mechanisms; the consequences of the finding are uncertain. As these agents are the most recent addition to our treatment possibilities in managing diabetes, there remains substantial uncertainty regarding their long-term safety and efficacy in the treatment of T2DM, though there is optimism about their potential value. In May 2015 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a notice about euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis in patients treated with SGLT2 inhibitors. In a case series, euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis developed in two patients with typical T2DM treated with SGLT2 inhibitors in the postoperative state. Treatment was delayed as the cause of the anion gap metabolic acidosis was not suspected because of relatively normal glucose levels. Any patient treated with SGLT2 inhibitors who experiences persistent or recurrent nausea, vomiting, or malaise, or who develops a metabolic acidosis, should be evaluated for the presence of urine and serum ketones, even if glucose levels are near normal.  788 \n \nInsulins \n \nInsulin has been commercially available since the early 1920s and is arguably still the mainstay of therapy for most people with T2DM worldwide. Subcutaneous injection of insulin in T2DM is designed to supplement endogenous production of insulin both in the basal state, to modulate hepatic glucose production, and in the postprandial state, in which a surge in insulin release normally facilitates glucose clearance into muscle and fat for storage to allow intraprandial metabolism. Currently, almost all insulin used worldwide is of recombinant human origin or an analogue. The available formulations largely differ in their pharmacokinetics, as shown in Table 31-12 .  \n \nInsulin lispro, insulin aspart, and insulin glulisine are rapid-acting insulin analogues that have an onset of action in 5 to 15 minutes, peak activity in approximately 1 hour, and duration of activity of approximately 4 hours. Regular insulin is approximately half as fast as the rapid-acting analogues, with onset in 30 minutes, a peak at 2 to 4 hours, and duration of action of 6 to 8 hours or longer. Regular human insulin, when administered intravenously, is instantly effective, with a half-life on the order of 10 minutes. Administered intramuscularly, regular human insulin has a half-life of approximately 20 minutes. Rapid-acting insulin analogues do not exhibit discernible advantages on intravenous or intramuscular administration. A variety of even more rapid-acting insulin formulations and delivery technologies are being developed. They may provide for greater advantage than available analogues. \n \nNeutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) is the only intermediate-acting insulin available since Lente insulin was withdrawn from the market. Onset, peak, and duration are about twofold greater than those of regular insulin, with an onset of action in 1 to 2 hours, a peak at 4 to 8 hours, and a duration of action of 12 to 16 hours. \n \nUltralente insulin is no longer available as human long-acting insulin. Insulin glargine is a long-acting insulin analogue that is solubilized in acid but precipitates when neutralized in tissues on injection, producing no consistent or distinctive peak in activity and a duration of action of more than 24 hours in most patients. Insulin detemir is a long-acting analogue in which a fatty-acid side chain has been covalently bound to the insulin molecule; it remains soluble both in the vial and in tissues and has a duration of action of approximately 24 hours except at low doses (<20 to 30 units). \n \nPremixed insulin formulations provide greater convenience and accuracy of mixing than those mixed by patients but at the expense of reduced flexibility. Premixed formulations available in the United States are 70/30 and 50/50 mixtures of NPH and regular insulin, a 75/25 and a 50/50 mixture of lispro insulin in its NPH-like formulation with insulin lispro, and a 70/30 mixture of insulin aspart with its NPH-like congener. Premixed insulin generally provides a profile of activity as expected from the addition of the activities of its components. \n \nVarious novel basal insulin formulations and analogues are being developed. Concentrated insulin glargine U-300, insulin degludec, and pegylated insulin lispro provide for extended durations of action and less within-day and day-to-day variability in pharmacodynamics and promise greater reductions in hypoglycemic risk, less weight gain, and potential improvements in glycemic control in the setting of T2DM.  789 \n \nOnce again an inhaled formulation of regular human insulin is available.  790  The device is quite convenient to carry and use. The insulin-loaded microparticles produce peak insulin levels in about 20 minutes with peak activity in 1 hour and a terminal half-life of 1 hour. In a subset of patients there has been great interest in inhaled insulin as a technique to avoid frequent injections. However, the current formulation requires spirometry before initiation, at 6 months, and annually thereafter; is contraindicated in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; provides precautions for patients with active lung cancer and smokers; is associated with cough, throat irritation, and throat pain in addition to the usual hypoglycemic risk; and is limited to 4-, 8-, and 12-unit doses. \n \nThe tactics of insulin administration in the setting of T2DM are the focus of great debate and strong opinion. Questions remain regarding the relative benefits of analogue insulins in light of the approximately threefold greater expense and whether the greater convenience of low-complexity regimens is justifiable in comparison with the greater risk associated with lesser flexibility in dosing, particularly in T2DM.  7 791 792  Adverse events associated with insulin are well known and include weight gain and hypoglycemia. Both fast-acting and long-acting insulin analogues have been shown to provide a modest reduction in hypoglycemia. Insulin allergies are rare, as are chronic skin reactions, which include lipodystrophy and lipohypertrophy. The absolute risk of severe hypoglycemia in patients with T2DM is relatively small, approximately one third to one tenth as high as in similarly treated patients with T1DM. This risk can be further minimized with appropriate education of patients and expectant home glucose monitoring at times when unrecognized hypoglycemia is most likely to occur, such as at midsleep or during unplanned or strenuous activity. \n \nNewer insulin needles cause less discomfort than those previously available because of a finer gauge, shorter length, sharper points, and smoother surfaces. Insulin pen technology makes teaching a patient to take insulin much easier and provides greater convenience and accuracy of dosing. Insulin pump therapy has been used in patients with T2DM but is not widely accepted as cost-effective in routine use. \n \nAmylinomimetics. \n \nAmylin is a neuroendocrine hormone that is cosecreted with insulin by pancreatic beta cells. As would be expected, amylin deficiencies are evident in patients with T1DM or T2DM, in parallel with the insulin deficiencies. Amylin and insulin have complementary actions in regulating plasma glucose. Amylin binds to brain nuclei. It promotes satiety and reduces appetite, and through vagal efferents it mediates a decrease in the rate of gastric emptying. It also regulates suppression of glucagon secretion in a glucose-dependent fashion, thus regulating the rate of glucose appearance from the gastrointestinal tract and the liver. Insulin, on the other hand, regulates the rate of glucose disappearance from the circulation by stimulating glucose uptake in muscle and fat. \n \nAmylin is relatively insoluble in aqueous solution and aggregates on plastic and glass. Pramlintide was developed as a soluble, nonaggregating, equipotent amylin analogue. It is indicated for patients with insulin-treated T2DM for mealtime subcutaneous injection. In patients with T2DM, when pramlintide was added to insulin therapy with or without a sulfonylurea or metformin, HbA 1c was reduced by about 0.5 to 0.7 percentage points, and weight was reduced by about 0.5 lb/month.  793 \n \nMild nausea, which wanes with continued therapy, is the most common adverse effect. It is minimized by titrating the dose from 60 µg with meals to the usual 120 µg over 3 to 7 days as tolerated. Hypoglycemia is less frequent in patients with T2DM than in patients with T1DM, who do occasionally exhibit severe hypoglycemia. Prandial insulin should be reduced by 50% when initiating therapy, although subsequent retitration to higher doses is often required. \n \nOral medications that require rapid absorption for effectiveness should be administered either 1 hour before or 2 hours after injection of pramlintide. \n \nColesevelam. \n \nColesevelam is a second-generation bile acid sequestrant. It was observed to mediate modest reductions in glucose during the clinical development program. An expanded program in patients with T2DM resulted in approval for marketing of this drug as an adjunct for the treatment of diabetes. It provides an HbA 1c reduction of about 0.5% in addition to approximately 15% improvement in LDL. HDL changes tend to be trivial. Triglycerides can increase by 5% to 20%. Gastrointestinal side effects affect 10% or more of patients but lead to withdrawals uncommonly. The mechanisms for the glycemic effects are not definitively known.  794 \n \nBromocriptine. \n \nA quick-release formulation of bromocriptine administered within 2 hours of rising in the morning has been developed and is approved for marketing in the United States. It is suggested that creating a circadian peak in central dopaminergic tone improves insulin sensitivity. Nausea is the most common adverse effect, occurring in about 30% of patients and leading to discontinuation in about 10% at highest doses; lower doses are better tolerated. HbA 1c reductions are generally modest but have been reported to be as high as 1.2%. In a 1-year safety study, broad cardiovascular outcomes were improved 40% compared with placebo.  795  Recent studies suggest substantial efficacy in the setting of inadequate glycemic control on high-dose insulin therapy.  796 \n \nPractical Aspects of Initiating and Progressively Managing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nA significant challenge in clinical decision making in diabetes is that the increased availability of therapeutic options for antihyperglycemic therapy is far ahead of adequate prospective outcome studies. Currently available clinical trial data have not identified the preferred agents in T2DM, either as initial therapy or in subsequent care. Each class of drugs and even individual agents within each class have advantages and limitations, and individual issues can significantly affect the appropriate choice of therapy in particular patients. Table 31-10 highlights some of the relative advantages and disadvantages of various agents and classes. \n \nGeneral Approach \n \nA general approach in the absence of any patient-specific factors is suggested in the algorithm presented in Figure 31-21 .  7 767  A growing body of experience suggests that the use of metformin as initial therapy in combination with diet, exercise, and a comprehensive diabetes education program can provide impressive lowering of glucose with essentially no risk of hypoglycemia. If the response is judged to be inadequate over 3 months, essentially any other agent can be added. There are six recommended second-line therapies: sulfonylurea, thiazolidinedione, DPP4 inhibitor, SGLT2 inhibitor, GLP-1 receptor agonist, and basal insulin. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. If HbA 1c above target persists for an additional 3 months, adding virtually any agent not yet prescribed is acceptable. There is little rationale or data on the combination of GLP-1 receptor agonist with DPP4 inhibitors. Though there is great excitement about using GLP-1 receptor agonists with SGLT2 inhibitors, as both are associated with weight loss, no randomized controlled trial data are yet available. Certainly the other antihyperglycemic agent alternatives can be used, although they may provide no distinct advantage over these seven.  \n \nFor patients whose glycemic control is farther than 1% from target, it is possible to use fixed-dose combination drugs at onset, and some advocate routine combination therapy. The combination of metformin and a DPP4 inhibitor is generally well tolerated, is not associated with weight gain or hypoglycemia, and has become quite popular. There are now more than a dozen fixed-dose combinations of two drugs from all five classes of oral agents on Figure 31-21 ; likewise, there are combinations of basal insulin and GLP-1 receptor agonists under development. Multiple daily injections of insulin plus metformin have been suggested as the final common therapy for most patients with diabetes who do not achieve adequate control otherwise for almost 2 decades. Only in this most recent guidance from the ADA and European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) has basal insulin plus GLP-1 receptor agonists been recommended as an alternative based on greater efficacy and a lower risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain.  767 797 \n \nThe most critical issue in long-term glycemic management is that of continuously reassessing with patients the adequacy of their control, examining glucose monitoring logs and HbA 1c values, and refining treatment regimens to achieve optimal control with the lowest doses of the fewest medications. Most patients in specialty care require two or more drugs to achieve recommended targets. In general, it is preferred to add agents if there was an improvement in control with the first agent selected and to continue to add agents as needed to achieve goals. Subsequent back-titration to optimize treatment is often possible after glycemic goals are achieved. The selection of initial therapy should be based on priorities mutually recognized by the patient and provider. When adding insulin in the management of inadequately controlled T2DM, some practitioners prefer to stop the oral antihyperglycemic agents and switch to insulin. Most continue the oral agents and add an evening dose of insulin. Classically, bedtime NPH insulin and, more recently, long-acting insulin analogues have been preferred for initiating insulin therapy. There are data suggesting that long-acting analogues can provide for lower morning glucose values with less nocturnal hypoglycemia or weight gain than NPH insulin, particularly in more overweight patients. Many patients eventually require more complex regimens, such as twice-daily injections or multiple-injection regimens, but insulin pump therapy is rarely used. \n \nSome advocate starting multiple-injection therapy with rapid-acting insulin at each meal if adequate control is not achieved with basal insulin. Although the finding is not intuitive, recent data suggest that adding a single injection of rapid-acting insulin (at the morning meal or at the largest meal) to basal insulin titrated to provide for FPG control provides for a similar level of HbA 1c as the multiple-injection regimen with less weight gain and hypoglycemia. As one progresses from an injection of basal insulin plus a single injection of rapid-acting insulin to higher-order regimens, it seems incumbent on the health care team to ensure that improved control develops or to simplify the regimen. Studies suggest that to achieve HbA 1c levels lower than 7%, many patients require insulin doses on the order of 1 to 2 units/kg per day in addition to metformin. In the typical patient with insulin-resistant T2DM, there is usually little advantage to splitting basal insulin into two injections; in general, if a second injection is needed it should be prandial insulin. \n \nIt is important that both patient and health care provider agree on how to reach the goals of therapy. Therefore, biases and concerns of the patient should be addressed when trying to determine which agent should be prescribed. These biases can be elucidated in interviews with patients through discussions of various strategies. \n \nStrategies \n \nMinimal Cost Strategy. \n \nFor a large fraction of patients, particularly those who are elderly, the cost of drugs is an overwhelming issue. Diet and exercise can be extremely effective and are almost cost-free. The least expensive drugs for the treatment of diabetes are the sulfonylureas, and metformin, thiazolidinediones, AGIs, and human insulin are relatively inexpensive. There can be marked differences in price by pharmacy, and websites are available to find the best prices.  798  Specifically with regard to human insulin, there is a store brand of human insulin (i.e., ReliOn), which is generally available for approximately one fourth the usual price of human insulin. Therefore, a minimum-cost strategy could start with a sulfonylurea or metformin or both and progress to the addition of bedtime NPH insulin. Although insulin is relatively inexpensive, at high doses (≥1 U/kg) the costs begin to rise and the benefits are modest, creating a rationale for adding a generic thiazolidinedione. Most pharmaceutical companies and some states and communities have programs to provide no-cost or low-cost medications to the poor. Many websites offer this information.  799  For an increasing number of patients, the major driving force in their drug expenses is the number of prescriptions, because each is associated with a copayment. This provides another rationale for the use of combination agents. \n \nMinimal Weight Gain Strategy. \n \nWeight gain associated with the treatment of diabetes is of concern to most clinicians and is often an overriding issue with patients. A strategy to minimize weight gain would emphasize diet and exercise and would almost certainly employ metformin as initial therapy. GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors are associated with moderate weight loss in most patients with long-term use, and they would almost always be used as second-line therapy if weight were truly the major consideration. AGIs, DPP4 inhibitors, colesevelam, and bromocriptine are all weight neutral. Currently there are no well-controlled studies that document the safety and efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors in combination. \n \nMinimal Progressive Beta-Cell Loss Strategy. \n \nProgressive loss of beta-cell function is the hallmark of diabetes. It results in progressive deterioration of glycemic control and the eventual need for insulin treatment. Thiazolidinediones seem to be associated with the lowest rate of secondary failure and sulfonylurea with the highest, at least in comparison to metformin. Adoption of a strategy to minimize progressive beta-cell loss would lead to the use of a thiazolidinedione with metformin as initial therapies and the avoidance of secretagogues. GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP4 inhibitors have been associated with improvements in beta-cell mass in rodent models, but this is completely unproved in humans. \n \nMinimal Injection Strategy. \n \nToo many patients are determined to avoid insulin injections at any cost. The minimal injection strategy could involve the use of almost any combination of oral agents. Metformin and thiazolidinediones in combination with either sulfonylureas or DPP4 inhibitors have been best studied. Injected insulin or a GLP-1 receptor agonist would be added only if absolutely necessary. As dulaglutide once weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy does not provide a visible needle as part of the injection device, some needle-phobic patients see it as an acceptable product. The strategy of using thiazolidinediones early in the course of diabetes, in the hope that this might reduce the rate of progressive beta-cell dysfunction, would be rational in this setting. It is important to try to dispel notions that insulin therapy is difficult, ominous, or fraught with peril by highlighting its efficacy and the great strides that have been made in insulin formulations and delivery devices. Most diabetic patients require insulin at some point in their lifetime. Quite a few patients who have resisted the use of insulin have not balked at GLP-1 receptor agonists. This suggests that, although patients may have identified the needle as the predominant barrier to insulin therapy, they really had other biases driving their fears. \n \nMinimal Insulin Resistance Strategy. \n \nThe possible atherogenic effects of insulin have been widely touted in the lay press and by marketing programs within the pharmaceutical industry. The relationship between circulating insulin levels and cardiovascular risk in nondiabetic populations is incontrovertible but is probably related to the presence of insulin resistance rather than the insulin concentrations per se. Furthermore, in essentially all studies of intensive management with insulin, improved outcomes were observed with insulin treatment. There are no clinical data to suggest that exogenous insulin is associated with adverse side effects or long-term complications beyond its hypoglycemic effects and the associated weight gain. A recent trial compared an insulin-providing strategy and an insulin-sparing strategy in high-risk patients in terms of mortality risk; there were essentially no differences in cardiovascular outcomes.  800  Adoption of a strategy to minimize insulin resistance would lead to the use of metformin and a thiazolidinedione before consideration of adding other agents. \n \nMinimal Effort Strategy. \n \nMany patients are capable of making only a minimal effort with regard to their diabetes. Questioning patients about their pill-taking history and their realistic ability to comply with a prescribed frequency of therapy is important. The usual twice-daily therapy with metformin is a barrier to its use; sustained-release metformin would be an acceptable alternative. Taking a once-a-day sulfonylurea, DPP4 inhibitor, or thiazolidinedione requires the least effort by the patient. Combination products may have a role in this setting. The use of basal insulin or a once-daily or once-weekly GLP-1 receptor agonist is relatively well accepted by patients to whom this consideration is important. Developing strategies to improve adherence and increase motivation is a long-term goal in this population. There are devices under development for delivering exenatide in a subcutaneous implanted capsule every 6 months.  801 \n \nHypoglycemia Avoidance Strategy. \n \nHypoglycemia avoidance is another important consideration for many patients. The AGIs and thiazolidinediones have been reported in small studies to reduce reactive hypoglycemia. Theoretically, GLP-1 receptor agonists, DPP4 inhibitors, and metformin should not be associated with hypoglycemia. Other oral agents could be added in any order, with the exception that insulin secretagogues would be added last, their dose minimized, and glyburide avoided. Nateglinide in particular among the secretagogues is associated with an exceptionally low risk of significant hypoglycemia. Basal insulin strategies seem to be associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia than prandial insulin.  802 \n \nPostprandial Targeting Strategy. \n \nAchieving postprandial glucose targets is generally associated with better control than just meeting premeal targets.  803  On the basis of epidemiologic studies, it has been suggested that postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) is more highly correlated with cardiovascular disease risk than FPG. However, correction for confounding variables such as components of the multiple metabolic syndrome has not been performed in these studies. Furthermore, there are no outcome studies that have demonstrated the superiority of these approaches in patients with T2DM. \n \nControl of postprandial glycemia can be achieved only with specific lifestyle efforts and pharmacologic agents that target PPG. PPG monitoring is helpful in this regard because it reinforces the goals and is the most effective measure to assess the effectiveness of treatment. Nonpharmacologic techniques that can improve postprandial control include lowering the carbohydrate content of meals, adding fiber, substituting monounsaturated fats for carbohydrates, and encouraging physical activity after meals. The pharmacologic approach includes AGIs, exenatide twice daily, and rapid-acting insulin analogues. Nateglinide and repaglinide provide a theoretical advantage in this situation compared with other secretagogues, although formal head-to-head studies comparing these agents with glimepiride and sustained-release glipizide have not been completed. \n \nPreventing Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus \n \nThe possibility that T2DM can be prevented in high-risk persons has been formally tested in a series of clinical trials reviewed elsewhere.  7  Lifestyle intervention seems to provide for a reduction of 30% to 60% in progression to diabetes over a 3- to 5-year time frame. These benefits seem to be sustained and best correlated with weight loss; however, the average sustained weight loss in these trials was modest, on the order of 5%. Metformin has likewise been associated with a somewhat more modest reduction in the progression of diabetes, although the benefit seemed to be similar to that of lifestyle intervention in those patients younger than 45 years of age, those with BMI greater than 35 kg/m 2 , and those with an FPG level greater than 110 mg/dL. On average, metformin was generally without effect in patients older than 60 years of age, those with a BMI of less than 30 kg/m 2 , and those with an FPG of less than 100 mg/dL. Acarbose has also been shown to reduce progression to diabetes, without evidence of diminished efficacy in different subgroups. The thiazolidinedi­ones seem to be the most active antihyperglycemic agents tested for prevention, with efficacy as great as or greater than that of lifestyle intervention. However, concern regarding the long-term safety of thiazolidinediones in relation to effects on weight, heart, and bones has limited the enthusiasm for use of this class for prevention. \n \nThe success of the lifestyle interventions is impressive, demonstrating conclusively that with a variety of techniques it is possible for patients to achieve physiologically relevant changes in body weight. It is unknown whether lifestyle plus medications provides even greater benefit. The questions that arise are how to screen for people at risk and what intervention should be initiated in those with an interest in prevention. It seems reasonable to screen on the basis of current recommendations, as outlined earlier primarily for case finding, but also recognizing that patients with abnormal glucose values (HbA 1c >5.7% and particularly ≥6%, FPG ≥100 mg/dL and particularly ≥110 mg/dL, or IGT) would be ideal candidates for preventive strategies. Certainly, high-risk persons should be counseled about nutritional approaches to achieve weight loss, instructed to increase physical activity, and observed prospectively to determine whether progression of hyperglycemia has occurred. Treatment for other cardiovascular risk factors should also be considered if they are present. \n \nIn the absence of outcome studies, it is difficult to strongly advocate for drug therapy to prevent diabetes, because significant diabetes complications are unlikely to develop in the short window of time during which glucose levels increase from an FPG of 100 to 126 mg/dL. On the other hand, metformin therapy seems innocuous enough, and its benefits are broad; therefore, consideration of metformin therapy in patients who are at particularly high risk is recommended.  7  An extension phase of the Diabetes Prevention Program that is under way should provide evidence concerning whether prevention or delay in the development of diabetes will prevent death or disability. \n \nFuture Directions \n \nThe present-day management of T2DM is significantly more effective and easier for patients than the situation that prevailed even in the 1990s. A better understanding of the barriers to effective diabetes management and how to overcome them would be of great benefit. Changes in the health care system in the United States promise to eradicate access to care as the major barrier to prevention of disabling complications. The epidemic in diabetes and obesity that is under way, coupled with the predicted early death and disability that follow, threatens to overwhelm health care systems globally. Screening for diabetes or prediabetes may be cost-saving.  804  Practical, cost-effective public health approaches to stem this tide are desperately needed.  805  Whether new blockbuster drugs exist in the pipeline of 180 novel pharmaceutical agents for the treatment of diabetes and its complications is uncertain.  806 807  Although the prognosis for people with diabetes has never been better, the major challenges that they face relate to the complexity and cost of care. The opportunities for therapies that broadly address the metabolic underpinnings and consequences of diabetes are enormous. \n \n \n \n
